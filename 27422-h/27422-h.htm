<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">PROLOGUE.</h3>
<hr class="hr4" />

<p>The traveller who reaches those enchanted gates of
the Far East which swing open at the palm-girt
shores of Ceylon, enters upon a new range of thought
and feeling. The first sight of tropical scenery
generally awakens a passionate desire for further
experiences of the vast Archipelago in the Southern
Seas which girdles the Equator with an emerald
zone. Lured onward by the scented breeze in that
eternal search for perfection destined to remain
unsatisfied where every step marks a higher ideal
than the one already attained, the pilgrim pursues
his endless quest, for human aspiration has never
yet touched the goal of desires and dreams. The
cocoanut woods of Ceylon and her equatorial
vegetation lead fancy further afield, for the glassy
straits of Malacca beckon the wanderer down their
watery highways to mysterious Java, where vast
forests of waving palms, blue chains of volcanic
mountains, and mighty ruins of a vanished civilisation,
loom before the imagination and invest the
tropical paradise with ideal attractions. The
island, seven hundred miles long, and described
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>by Marianne North as "one magnificent garden
of tropical luxuriance," has not yet become
a popular resort of the average tourist, but
though lacking some of those comforts and
luxuries found under the British flag, it offers
many compensations in the wealth of beauty and
interest afforded by scenery, architecture, and
people. The two days' passage from Singapore lies
through a green chain of countless islets, once the
refuge of those pirates who thronged the Southern
seas until suppressed by European power. The cliffs
of Banka, honeycombed with tin quarries, and the
flat green shores of Eastern Sumatra, stretching
away to the purple mountains of the interior, flank
the silvery straits, populous with native <i>proas</i>,
coasting steamers, <i>sampans</i>, and the hollowed log or
"dug-out" which serves as the Malayan canoe.
Patched sails of scarlet and yellow, shaped like bats'
wings, suggest gigantic butterflies afloat upon the
tranquil sea. The red roofs of whitewashed towns,
and the tall shafts of white lighthouses emphasise
the rich verdure between the silvery azure of sky
and water. The little voyage ends at Tandjon
Priok, nine miles from Batavia, for a volcanic
eruption of Mount Salak in 1699 filled up the ancient
harbour, and necessitated the removal of shipping
to a deep bay, as the old city was landed high and
dry through the mass of mud, lava, and volcanic
sand, which dammed up the lower reaches of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Tjiligong river, and destroyed connection with the
sea. The present model harbour, erected at
tremendous cost, permits ships of heavy burden to
discharge passengers and cargo with comfort and
safety at a long wharf, without that unpleasant
interlude of rocking <i>sampans</i> and reckless boatmen
common to Eastern travel. A background of blue
peaks and clustering palms rises beyond the long
line of quays and breakwaters flanked by the
railway, and a wealth of tropical scenery covers
a marshy plain with riotous luxuriance. No
Europeans live either in Tandjon Priok or Old
Batavia, and the locality was known for two
centuries as "the European graveyard." Flourishing
Arab and Chinese <i>campongs</i> or settlements
appear immune from the terrible Java fever
which haunts the morasses of the coast, and the
industrial Celestial who absorbs so much of Oriental
commerce, possesses an almost superhuman imperviousness
to climatic dangers.</p>

<p>In the re-adjustment of power after the Fall of
Napoleon, Java, invaded by England in 1811, after
a five years' interval of British rule under the
enlightened policy of Sir Stamford Raffles, was
restored to the Throne of Holland. The supremacy
of the Dutch East India Company, who, after a
prolonged struggle, acquired authority in Java as
residuary legatee of the Mohammedan Emperor,
ended at the close of the eighteenth century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Perpetual warfare and rebellion, which broke out
in Central Java after the return of the island to the
Dutch, taxed the resources of Holland for five years.
Immense difficulties arrested and delayed the
development of the fertile territory, until the
"culture system" of forced labour within a certain
area relieved the financial pressure. One-fifth of
village acreage was compulsorily planted with sugar-cane,
and one day's work every week was demanded
by the Dutch Government from the native population.
The system was extended to tea and coffee;
and indigo was grown on waste land not needed for
the rice, which constitutes Java's staff of life. Spices
and cinchona were also diligently cultivated under
official supervision, and the lives of many explorers
were lost in search of the precious Kina-tree,
until Java, after years of strenuous toil, now
produces one-half of that quinine supply which
proves the indispensable safeguard of European
existence on tropic soil. The ruddy bark and scarlet
branches of the cinchona groves glow with autumnal
brightness amid the evergreen verdure of the
Javanese hills, and the "culture system," as a
financial experiment, proved, in spite of cavillers,
a source of incalculable benefit to the natives as
well as to the colonists of Java. As we travel
through the length and breadth of an island cultivated
even to the mountain tops with the perfection
of detail common to the Dutch, as the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>horticulturists of the world, we realise the far-reaching
wisdom, which in a few decades transformed
the face of the island, clearing vast tracks
of jungle, and pruning that riot of tropical nature
which destroys as rapidly as it creates. A lengthened
survey of Java's political economy and past history
would be out of place in a slight volume, written as
a "compagnon de voyage" to the wanderer who
adds a cruise in the Archipelago to his Eastern
itinerary, but the colonial features of Dutch rule
which have produced many beneficial results demand
recognition, for the varied characteristics of national
genius and racial expansion suggest the myriad
aspects of that creative power bestowed on humanity
made in the Divine Image, and fulfilling the great
destiny inspired by Heavenly Wisdom.</p>

<h2>JAVA.</h2>
<hr class="hr4" style="width: 3em;" />

<h3>BATAVIA AND WELTEVREDEN.</h3>


<p>From the railway station at Batavia the comfortless
"dos-a-dos," colloquially known as the <i>sado</i>, a
vehicle resembling an elementary Irish car, and
drawn by a rat-like Timor pony transports us to
the fashionable suburb of Weltevreden, away from
the steamy port and fever-haunted commercial
capital. The march of modern improvement scarcely
affects old-world Java, where jolting <i>sado</i> and
ponderous <i>milord</i> remain unchanged since the
early days of colonisation, for time is a negligeable
quantity in this lotus-eating land, too apathetic even
to adopt those alleviations of tropical heat common
to British India. The Java of the ancient
world was considered "The Jewel of the East,"
and possesses many claims to her immemorial title,
but the stolid Dutchman of to-day contents himself
with the domestic arrangements which sufficed for
his sturdy forefathers, scorning the mitigations of
swinging punkah or electric fan. The word Batavia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>signifies "fair meadows," and these swampy fields
of rank vegetation, exhaling a deadly miasma, were
considered such an adequate defence against hostile
attack, that forts were deemed unnecessary in a
locality where 87,000 soldiers and sailors died in the
Government Hospital during the space of twenty
years. Batavia proper is a commonplace city of
featureless streets, brick-walled canals, and ramshackle
public buildings, but the residential town
of Weltevreden, suggesting a glorified Holland,
combines the quaint charm of the mother country
with the Oriental grace and splendour of the tropics.
The broad canals bordered by colossal cabbage-palms,
the white bridges gay with the many
coloured garb of the Malay population, the red-tiled
roofs embowered in a wealth of verdure, and the
pillared verandahs veiled with gorgeous creepers,
tumbling in sheets of purple and scarlet from cornice
to floor, compose a characteristic picture, wherein
Dutch individuality triumphs over incongruous
environment. Waving palms clash their fronds in
the sea-breeze; avenues of feathery tamarind and
bending waringen trees surround Weltevreden with
depths of green shadow; the scarlet hybiscus flames
amid tangled foliage, where the orange chalices
of the flowering Amherstia glisten from sombre
branches, and hang like fairy goblets from the
interwoven roofs of tropical tunnels, pierced by
broad red roads. On this Sunday afternoon of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>waning year which introduces us to Weltevreden,
family groups are gathered round tea tables
canopied with flowers and palms, in the white
porticos of the Dutch villas, and the startling
d&eacute;shabille adopted by Holland in the Netherlands
India almost defies description. The ladies, with
stockingless feet thrust into heelless slippers, and
attired in the Malay <i>sarong</i> (two yards of painted
cotton cloth), supplemented by a white dressing-jacket,
display themselves in verandah, carriage, or
street, in a garb only fit for the bath-room; while
the men, lounging about in pyjamas, go barefoot
with the utmost <i>sangfroid</i>. The <i>sarong</i>, as worn
by the slender and graceful Malay, appears a modest
and appropriate garb, but the grotesque effect of
native attire on the broad-built Dutchwoman affords
conclusive proof that neither personal vanity nor a
sense of humour pertain to her stolid personality.
Dutch Puritanism certainly undergoes startling
transformations under the tropical skies, and the
Netherlands India produces a modification of
European ideas concerning what have been called
"the minor moralities of life," unequalled in
colonial experience. An identical exhibition fills
the open corridors of the Hotel Nederlanden, built
round a central court, and the general resort of the
guests during the hot hours of the January days.
Evening dress is reserved for State occasions,
and though <i>sarong</i> and <i>kabaja</i> be discarded at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>the nine o'clock dinner, the blouse and skirt of
morning wear in England suffices even at this late
hour for the fair Hollander, who also concedes so
far to the amenities of civilisation as sometimes to
put on her stockings. So much of life in Java is
spent in eating, sleeping, and bathing, that but a
small residuum can be spared for those outside
interests which easily drop away from the European
when exiled to a colony beyond the beaten track of
travel, and destitute of that external friction which
counteracts the enervating influence of the tropics.
Comfort is at a discount according to English ideas,
but the arrangements of the Hotel Nederlanden,
under a kindly and capable proprietor, render it an
exception to the prevailing rule. Each guest is
apportioned a little suite, consisting of bedroom,
sitting-room, and a section of the verandah, fitted
up with cane lounge, table, and rocking-chair. The
bathrooms, with porcelain tank and tiles, leave
nothing to be desired, and the "dipper-bath,"
infinitely cooler than the familiar tub, becomes
an unfailing delight. Ominous prophecies have
emphasised the rashness of coming to Java in the
rainy season, but it has expended its force before
January arrives, and though daily showers cool the
air, and the sky is often overcast, no inconvenience
is experienced. Lizards and mosquitoes are few,
and in the marble-floored dining hall of cathedral
proportions the absence of a punkah is generally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>unfelt, though the fact of a tropical climate is
realised at the slightest exertion. The day begins
at 6 a.m. with a cup of the Java coffee, which, at
first unpalatable, reveals by degrees the hidden
excellence of the beverage, brought cold in a
stoppered cruet, the potent essence requiring a
liberal admixture of boiling water. At 9 a.m. a
solid but monotonous breakfast of sausage, bacon,
eggs, and cheese is customary, with the accompaniment
of iced water, though tea and coffee are
provided for the foreign traveller, unused to the cold
comfort which commends itself to Dutch taste. The
mid-day <i>riz-tavel</i> from beginning to end of a
stay in Java, remains the terror of the English
visitor. Each plate is heaped with a mound of rice,
on which scraps of innumerable ingredients are
placed&mdash;meat, fish, fowl, duck, prawns, curry, fried
bananas, and nameless vegetables, together with
chilis and chutneys, sembals, spices, and grated
cocoanut, in bewildering profusion. The Dutch
digestion triumphantly survives this severe test at
the outset of the meal, and courageously proceeds
to the complementary courses of beefsteak, fritters
and cheese. Fortunately for those of less vigorous
appetite, mine host of the Nederlanden, far in
advance of his Javanese fraternity, kindly provides
a simple "tiffin" as an alternative to this
Gargantuan repast. Afternoon tea is served in the
verandah, and at eight o'clock the Dutch contingent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>having slept off the effects of the rice table, prepares
with renewed energies to attack a heavy dinner.
New Year's Eve is celebrated by a very bombardment
of fireworks from the Chinese <i>campong</i>, and
crowds hasten to the fine Roman Catholic church
for Benediction, Te Deum, and an eloquent, though
to me incomprehensible, Dutch sermon. Crisp
muslins and uncovered heads for the women, and
white linen garb for the men, are the rule in church,
for the slatternly undress of <i>sarong</i> and pyjamas
is happily inadmissible within the walls of the
sanctuary, where the fair fresh faces and neat array
compose a pleasing picture which imagination would
fail to evolve from the burlesque ugliness of the
slovenly d&eacute;shabille wherewith the Dutch colonist
disguises every claim to beauty or grace. On
alluding to the shock experienced by this grotesque
travesty of native garb, a Dutch officer asserts that
there are in reality but few Dutch ladies in Java of
pure racial stock, for one unhappy result of remoteness
from European influence is shown by the
gradual merging of the Dutch colonists into the
Malay race by intermarriage. Exile to Java was
made financially easy and attractive by the Dutch
Government, but it was for the most part a
permanent separation from the mother country, and
a long term of years necessarily elapsed before the
colonial planter could even return for a short visit
to his native land. The overwhelming force of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>public opinion against mixed marriages, and the
consequent degeneration of type, from a union which
lowers one of the contracting parties without raising
the other, beats but faintly against these remote
shores, cut off from associations which mould and
modify the crudities of individual thought in regions
swept by the full tide of contemporary life. The
idea of welding European and Asiatic elements into
one race, as a defence against external aggression,
possesses a superficial plausibility, but ages of
historical experiment only confirm the unalterable
truth of the poetic dictum that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">East is East, and West is West,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And never the two shall meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until they stand on either hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At God's great Judgment Seat!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sudden rise of an Oriental race to the position
of a great world-power, and the apprehensions of
coming struggles for supremacy in Eastern waters,
present many future complications concerning Java,
even if not weakened by the assimilation of her
European colonists to an inferior race.</p>

<p>Neither landlord nor secretary of the Hotel
Nederlanden spare time or trouble in arranging the
programme of sight-seeing, and but for their kindly
help, only a partial success would be possible, owing
to the difficulties presented by the two unknown
tongues of Dutch and Malay. Ignorance of the
former involves separation from the world as revealed
by newspapers, and though a smattering of "coolie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Malay" is picked up with the aid of a handbook,
and the "hundred words" mastered, sanguinely
asserted to suffice for colloquial needs, there are
many occasions when even the practice of this
elementary language requires a more extensive
vocabulary. At a New Year's f&ecirc;te given by the
proprietor of the hotel to his numerous Malay
employ&eacute;s, we make our first acquaintance with
native music. Dancing girls, in mask and tinsel,
gyrate to the weird strains of the <i>Gamelon</i>, an
orchestra of tiny gongs, bamboo tubes, and metal
pipes. Actors perform old-world dramas in dumb
show, and conjurors in gaudy attire attract people
of all ages to those time-honoured feats of legerdemain
which once represented the sorcery of the
mystic East. The simple Malay has not yet adopted
the critical and unbelieving attitude which rubs the
gilt off the gingerbread or the bloom off the plum,
and his fervid faith in mythical heroes and necromantic
exploits gives him the key to that kingdom
of fancy often closed to a sadder if wiser world.
The electric tram provides an excellent method of
gaining a general idea of Batavia and Weltevreden;
the winding route skirting canals and palm groves,
<i>campongs</i> of basket-work huts, and gay <i>passers</i>,
the native markets, with their wealth of many-coloured
fruit. Stacks of golden bananas, olive-tinted
dukus, rambutans like green chestnut-shells
with scarlet prickles, amber star-fruit, brown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>salak, the "forbidden apple," bread-fruit, and
durian offer an embarassing choice. Pineapples
touch perfection on Java soil; cherimoya and mango,
papaya and the various custard-fruits, the lovely but
tasteless rose-apple, and the dark green equatorial
orange of delicious flavour, afford a host of unfamiliar
experiences. The winter months are the season of
the peerless mangosteen, in beauty as well as in
savour the queen of tropical fruits. The rose-lined
purple globes, with the central ball of ivory
whiteness in each fairy cup, suggest fugitive
essences of strawberry and nectarine combined with
orange to produce this equatorial marvel, also
considered perfectly wholesome. The mangosteen,
ripening just north or south of the Equator,
according to the alternations of the wet and dry
seasons, cannot be preserved long enough to reach
the temperate zone, and though every year shows
fresh varieties of tropical fruit successfully transported
to European markets, the mangosteen remains
unknown outside the narrow radius of the equatorial
region to which the tree is indigenous. The flower
markets blaze with many-coloured roses, tons of
gardenias and a wealth of white heavy-scented
flowers, such as tuberoses and Arabian jasmine. All
the spices of the East, in fact, seem breathing from
these mounds of blossom, as well as from gums and
essences distilled from them in archaic fashion.
Transparent sachets, filled with the scented petals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>of <i>ylang-ylang</i>, fill the air with intoxicating sweetness,
and outside the busy <i>passer</i>, a frangipanni-tree,
the native <i>sumboya</i> or "flower of the dead,"
just opening a white crowd of golden-hearted
blossoms to the sun, adds another wave of perfume
to the floral incense, steaming from earth to sky with
prodigal exuberance.</p>

<p>Batavia possesses few objects of interest. The
dismal green-shuttered Stadkirche, a relic of Dutch
Calvinism; the earliest warehouse of the Netherlands
Company, a commonplace lighthouse, and the gate
of Peter Elberfeld's dwelling (now his tomb), with
his spear-pierced skull above the lintel, as a reminder
of the sentence pronounced on traitors to the Dutch
Government, comprise the scanty catalogue. Antiquities
and arch&aelig;ological remains fill a white
museum of classical architecture on the Koenig's
Plein, a huge parade ground, flanked by the
Palace of the Governor-General. Gold and silver
ornaments, gifts from tributary princes, shield and
helmet, dagger, and <i>kris</i>, of varied stages in Malay
civilisation, abound in these spacious halls, where
every Javanese industry may be studied. Buddhist
and Hindu temples have yielded up a treasury of
images, censers, and accessories of worship, the
excavations of ruined cities in Central Java, long
overgrown with impenetrable jungle, opening a mine
of arch&aelig;ological wealth in musical instruments,
seals, coins, headgear, chairs and umbrellas of State.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Golden pipes and betel-boxes show the perfection of
the goldsmith's art, and metal statues vie with those
of sculptured wood or stone. Here Captain Cook
left his treasure trove from the Southern seas, and
the Council Chamber of the Museum contains
portraits and souvenirs of the great navigators who
sailed into the uncharted ocean of geographical
discovery, and in various stages of their adventurous
careers anchored at Java, to display the wondrous
trophies of unknown lands in the island then
regarded as the farthest outpost of contemporary
civilisation.</p>

<p>The <i>toelatingskaart</i>, or Javanese passport, formerly
indispensable for insular travel beyond the
radius of forty miles from Batavia, though not yet
obsolete, proves practically needless, and is never
once demanded during a six weeks' stay. The small
addition contributed to the rich revenue by this
useless official "permit," appears the sole reason
for retaining it, now that vexatious restrictions are
withdrawn. In the intervals of arranging an
up-country tour from monotonous Weltevreden,
destitute of any attraction beyond the white
colonnades and verdant groves flanking sleepy canals
and quaint bridges, the local industry of <i>sarong</i>
stippling affords a curious interest. Every city in
Java possesses a special type of this historic dress,
represented on the walls of temples dating before the
Christian era, and worn by the Malay races from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>time immemorial. This strip of cotton cloth, which
forms the attire both of men and women, is twisted
firmly round the body, and requires no girdle
to secure it. Palm-fronds, birds, and animals,
geometric patterns, religious emblems, fruits and
flowers, are represented in bewildering confusion.
The girls, with flower-decked hair and scanty garb,
occupy a long, low shed, filled with rude frames for
stretching the cloth, painted in soft-tinted dyes&mdash;brown,
blue, and amber for the most part&mdash;with
tapering funnels. These waxed cloths allow infinite
scope for native imagination, only a small panel of
formal design being obligatory, the remaining
surface fancifully coloured at will in harmonious
hues. No two <i>sarongs</i> are alike, and the painted
<i>battek</i>, notwithstanding the simplicity of the
cotton background, represents an amount of labour
and finish which makes the archaic garment a costly,
though almost indestructible production. The
graceful <i>slandang</i>, a crossed scarf of the same
material, only serves as a shoulder-strap, wherein
the brown Malay baby sits contentedly, for the ugly
white jacket of the Dutchwoman is now compulsory
on the native. Every variety of <i>battek</i>, basket-work,
mats, and quaint silver or brass ware, is
brought by native peddlers to the broad verandahs of
the hotel, the patient and gentle people content to
spend long hours on the marble steps, dozing
between their scanty bargains, or crimsoning their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>months with the stimulating morsel of betel-nut,
said to allay the hunger, thirst, and exhaustion of
the steaming tropics. The conquered race, cowed
by ages of tyranny under native princes, possesses
those mild and effeminate characteristics fostered by
a languid and enervating climate. That the salient
angles of the sturdy Dutch character, which
accomplished so many feats of endurance in the
earlier days of the colony, should undergo rapid
disintegration by intermarriage with the native
stock, must arouse regret in all who realise the
claims to respect possessed by the fighting forefathers
of Holland's tropical dependencies.</p>

<p>Educational matters were for centuries in abeyance,
and until 1864 the Malays were forbidden to
learn the language of their European rulers. Many
dialects are found in Java's wide territory, but Low
Malay has been declared the official tongue, and
with the advance of public opinion, wider views
prevail concerning the rights of the subject race.
A good Roman Catholic priest, one of the most
enlightened and liberal Dutchmen encountered in
Java, asserts that in the schools of the Colonial
Government, the Malay boy possesses a mathematical
facility superior to that of the Dutch scholar, in
spite of the advantage accruing from hereditary
education.</p>

<p>At the sunset hour, Batavian life awakens from
the long slumbers of the tropical afternoon, and as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>the golden light filters through the waving palms,
the long Schul-Weg, beside the central canal, fills
with saunterers, enjoying the delights of that
brief spell, when peace and coolness fall on the
world before the sudden twilight drops veil after veil
of deepening gloom, merging into the "darkness
which may be felt," for the twelve hours of the
tropical night. Gathering clouds reveal but scanty
glimpses of the moon in these January weeks, but
through rifts in the sombre canopy, the Southern
stars hang low in the dome of heaven, and shine
like burning lamps, appearing almost within reach
of an outstretched hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h3>BUITENZORG.</h3>


<p>The first destination of the up-country traveller in
Java is Buitenzorg, the Dutch "Sans Souci,"
containing the Governor-General's rural Palace, the
houses of Court officials, and the superb Botanical
Garden, which ranks first among the horticultural
triumphs of the world. The two hours' journey by
the railway, which now traverses the whole of Java,
shows a succession of tropical landscapes, appearing
unreal in their fantastic and dream-like beauty.
The glowing green of rice-fields, the dense forests of
swaying palms, the porphyry tints of the teeming
soil, and the purple mountains, carved into the weird
contours peculiar to volcanic ranges, frame myriad
pictures of unfamiliar native life with dramatic
effect. Villages of woven basket-work cluster
beneath green curtains of banana and spreading
canopies of palm, the central mosque surmounting
the tiny huts with many-tiered roofs, and walls
inlaid with gleaming tiles of white and blue. Brown
figures, with gay <i>sarong</i> and turbaned headgear,
bring bamboo buckets to moss-grown wells, gray
water-buffaloes crop marshy herbage, a little bronze-hued
figure seated on each broad back, and busy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>workers stand knee-deep in slush, to transplant
emerald blades of rice or to gather the yellow crops,
for seedtime and harvest go on together in this
fertile land. Our train halts at Depok, a Christian
village unique in Java, for the religious history of
the island shows little missionary enterprise among
a race strangely indifferent to the claims of faith,
and lightly casting away one creed after another,
with a carelessness which has ever proved a formidable
bar to spiritual progress. The Portuguese
Jesuits were expelled by the Dutch, and English
efforts at conversion were succeeded by a general
exclusion of foreign missionaries. Public opinion
eventually prevented the continuance of this despotic
rule, and at the present day a certain number of
Roman and Protestant clergy are supported by the
Government, but Roman zeal outstrips the niggardly
spiritual provision, and proves the appreciation in
which it is held by full churches and devout
worshippers. The Mohammedanism of the Malay
lacks the fiery fervour common to Islam, and his
slack hands are ever ready to forego all symbols of
faith. From the region of rice and tapioca, maize
and sugar-cane, we reach the great cacao plantations,
hung with chocolate-coloured pods, and the ruddy
kina-groves on the lower slopes of the mountain
chain. The palms are everywhere, clashing their
huge fronds, and undulating in waves of fiery green,
the light and shadow of the golden evening reflected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>on the swaying foliage. Stately Palmyra, slender
areca, graceful pandang with a length of scarlet
crowning each smooth grey stem, the mighty royal
palm, king of the forest, spreading cocoanuts, and a
hundred unknown varieties, soaring among bread-fruit
and teak, nutmeg and waringen, reveal the
inexhaustible powers of tropical Nature. Buitenzorg
occupies an ideal position between the blue and
violet peaks of Gedeh and Salak, the guardian
mountains of the fairy spot, perennially green with
spring-like freshness, from the daily showers
sweeping across the valley from one or other
of the lofty crests, and possessing a delicious
climate at an altitude of eight hundred feet.
The Hotel Bellevue, where <i>back</i> rooms should
be secured on account of a superb prospect,
comprising river, mountain and forest, stands
near the great entrance of the world-famous
Gardens, and our balcony commands a profound
ravine, carved by a clear river, winding away
between forests of palm to the dark cone of Mount
Salak, the climax of the picture. The artist
destined to interpret the soul of Java is yet unborn,
or unable to grasp the character of her unique and
distinctive scenery, but a village of plaited palm-leaves,
accentuating this tropical Eden, brings it
down to the human level, where soft Malay voices,
glimpses of domestic life, and a canoe afloat on
the brimming stream, remind us that we are still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>on <i>terra firma</i>, and not gazing at a dreamland
Paradise beyond earthly ken. Sleeping accommodation
in the hills suggests little comfort. A
hard mattress beneath a sheet is the sole furniture
of the huge four-poster, surrounded by thick muslin
curtains to exclude air and creeping things; pillows
are stuffed hard with cotton-down, and no coverings
are provided&mdash;an unalterable custom possessing
obvious disadvantages in a climate reeking with
damp, where the walls of a room closed for a day or
two become green with mould. Rheumatic stiffness
on waking is a matter of course in humid Java, for
the hour between darkness and dawn contains a
concentrated essence of dew, mist, and malaria,
which penetrates to the very marrow of unaccustomed
bones, even when it lacks the frequent
accompaniment of the violent cascade known as "a
tropical shower." The glorious Botanical Garden
is approached by a mighty avenue of colossal kanari-trees,
over a hundred feet high, with yellow light
filtering through the fretted roof of interlacing
boughs, which suggests a vast aisle in some primeval
forest. Stately columns and spreading roots garlanded
with stag-horn ferns, waving moss, white and purple
orchids, or broad-leaved creepers, falling in sheets
and torrents of shining foliage and knitting tree to
tree, attest the irrepressible growth of vegetation,
which flings a many-coloured veil of blossom and
leaf over root, branch, and stem. A fairy lake
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>glows with the pink and crimson blossoms of the
noble Victoria Regia, the huge leaves like green
tea-trays floating on the water, where a central
fountain adds prismatic radiance to the scenic effect
of the splendid lilies. Climbing palms and massive
creepers, splashed with orange, scarlet, and gold,
tumble in masses from lofty branches, and the
dazzling Bougainvillea flings curtains of roseate
purple over wall and gateway. A dense thicket
of frangipanni scents the air with the symbolic
blossoms, shining like stars from grey-green boughs
of sharp-cut leaves. A copse of splendid tree-ferns
flanks the forest-like plantation known as "The
Thousand Palms," and beneath dusky avenues of
waringen (a variety of the banyan species, which
strikes staff-like boughs into the earth and springs
up again in caverns of foliage), herds of deer are
wandering, snatching at drooping vines, or sheltering
from the fierce sun in depths of impenetrable shade.
Tufts of red-stemmed Banka palms cluster on the
green islets of lake and river, vista after vista opens
up, each mysterious aisle appearing more lovely than
the last, and luring the wanderer to the climax
formed by a terraced knoll, commanding a superb
view of Gedeh and Salak, the twin summits of
chiselled turquoise, gashed by the amethyst shadows
of deep ravines, with Gedeh's curl of volcanic smoke
staining the lustrous azure of the sky. Many-coloured
tree carnations, gorgeous cannas and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>calladiums, copses of snowy gardenia, and flowering
shrubs of rainbow hues, blaze with splendour, or
exhale their wealth of perfume on the languid air,
thronged with the invisible souls of the floral
multitude. Graceful rattans shoot up in tall ladders
of foliage-hidden cane, climbing to the topmost
fronds of the loftiest palm, and, unless ruthlessly cut
down, overthrowing the stately tree with their fatal
embrace. Sausage and candle trees, with strange
parodies of prosaic food and waxen tapers, climbing
palms, sometimes extending for five hundred feet,
and gigantic blossoms like crimson trumpets, or delicately-tinted
shells of ocean, comprise but a tithe
of Nature's wonders, crowned by the mighty
"Rafflesia," the largest flower in the world, with
each vast red chalice often measuring a circumference
of six feet. A hundred native gardeners are
employed in this park-like domain, and seventy men
work in the adjacent culture-garden of forty acres,
where experiments in grafting and acclimatizing
are carried on, as well as in the supplementary
garden of Tjibodas, beautifully situated on the lower
slopes of Mount Salak. The white palace of the
Governor-General faces the lake, fed by the lovely
river Tjiligong, winding in silver loops round verdant
lawn and palm-clad hill, or expanding into bamboo-fringed
lakes, and bringing perennial freshness into
the tropical Eden of sun-bathed Java.</p>

<p>Beyond the fretted arches of the great kanari
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>avenue, the white tomb of Lady Raffles, who died
during her husband's term of office in the island,
forms a pathetic link with the past. When the
colony was restored to Holland, a clause in the treaty
concerning it, made the perpetual care of this
monument, to one deeply loved and mourned,
binding upon the Dutch Governor&mdash;a condition
loyally observed during the century since the
cessation of English rule. Cinnamon and clove
scent the breeze which whispers mysterious secrets
to the swaying plumes of the tall sago-palms, and
dies away in the delicate foliage of tamarind and
ironwood tree. A network of air roots makes a
grotesque circle round the spreading boughs of the
banyan grove, mahogany and sandal-wood, ebony
and cork, ginger-tree and cardamom, mingle their
varied foliage, the translucency of sun-smitten green
shading through deepening tones into the sombre
tints of ilex and pine with exquisite gradation.
Flamboyant trees flaunt fiery pyramids of blossom
high in the air, and the golden bouquets of the
salacca light up dusky avenues, where large-leaved
lianas rope themselves from tree to tree in cables of
vivid green. Bare stems, except in the palms, are
unknown in this richly-decorated temple of Nature;
climbing blade-plants with sword-like leaves of gold-striped
verdure, huge orchids like many-coloured
birds and butterflies fluttering in the wind, wreathe
trunk and branch with fantastic splendour, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>matted creepers weave curtains of dense foliage from
spreading boughs. The austere and scanty vegetation
of Northern climes, which gives a distinct
outline and value to every leaf and flower, has
nothing in common with the prodigal and passionate
beauty of the tropical landscape, where the wealth
of earth is flung broadcast at our feet in mad
profusion. Day by day the marvellous gardens of
Buitenzorg take deeper hold of mind and imagination.
The early dawn, when the dark silhouettes
of the palms stand etched against the rose-tinted
heavens, the hot noontide in the shadows of the
colossal kanari-trees, the sunset gold transfiguring
the foliage into emerald fire, and spilling pools of
liquid amber upon the mossy turf, or the white
moonlight which transmutes the forest aisles into a
fairy world of sable and silver, invest this vision of
Paradise with varied aspects of incomparable beauty.
The surrounding scenery, though full of interest,
seems but the setting of the priceless gem, and when
inexorable Time, the modern angel of the flaming
sword, at length bars the way, and banishes us from
our Javanese Eden, the exiled heart turns back
perpetually to the floral sanctuary, the antitype of
that Divinely-planted Garden on the dim borderland
of Time which revealed and fulfilled the primeval
beauty of earth's morning hours.</p>

<h3>SOEKABOEMI AND SINDANGLAYA.</h3>


<p>Soekaboemi (Desire of the World), a favourite
sanatorium of the Dutch, is approached by an
exquisite railway, curving round the purple heights
of forest-girt Salak. The usual afternoon deluge
weeps itself away, palm plumes and cassava boughs,
overhanging the silvery Tjiligong, drop showers of
diamonds into the current, and giant bamboos creak
in the spicy wind, redolent of gardenia and clove.
The hills, scaled by green rice-terraces, each with
tiny rill and miniature cascade, are vocal with
murmuring waters. Lilac plumbago, red hybiscus,
and golden allemanda mingle with pink and purple
lantana, yellow daisies, and hedges of scarlet tassels,
enclosing wicker huts in patches of banana and
cocoanut. Brown girls, in blue and orange <i>sarongs</i>,
occupy the steps of a basket-work shrine, from
whence an unknown god, smeared with ochre,
extends a sceptred hand, for Hinduism left deep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>traces on inland Java, dim with the dust of vanished
creeds. The expense and trouble of former travel
by the superb post-roads, made at terrible sacrifice
of life in earlier days, is now done away with,
though the noble avenues and picturesque shelters,
erected for protection from sun or rain, suggest a
pleasant mode of leisurely progress. No trains may
run at night, not only on account of native
incompetence, but from dangers caused by constant
geographical changes on this volcanic soil, where
rivers suddenly alter their course, and earthquakes
obstruct the way with yawning chasms or heaps of
debris. A paternal Government provides the
traveller with a half-way house, erecting a large
hotel at Maos, with uniform rates, entirely for the
benefit of the passenger by rail. Trains are built
on the American plan, stations are spacious and
airy, refreshments easily secured, and every halting-place
offers an <i>embarras de richesses</i> in the shape of
tropical fruits, wherewith to supplement or replace
the solidity of the Dutch commissariat. Coffee and
tea plantations in ordered neatness, contrast with
the untamed profusion of forest vegetation, clothing
sharp promontory and shelving terrace. Dusky
villages cling like birds' nests to ledges of rock,
screw-palms with airy roots frame mountain tarns,
and a Brazilian Emperor-palm, with smooth column
bulging into a pear-shaped base, accentuates the
sunset glory from a crag crowned by the black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>canopy of colossal fronds. The Preanger Regency
was the heart of ancient Mataram, that historic
kingdom of old-world Java round which perpetual
warfare waged for centuries.</p>

<p>Language and customs change as we cross the
saddle between the blue peaks of Salak and Gedeh;
gay crowds bring fruits to picturesque wayside
markets, bearing bamboo poles laden with golden
papaya and purple mangosteen, or plaited baskets
containing the conglomerate native cuisine. The
elastic and gracefully-modelled figures of the
Soendanese populace betoken a purer race than that
of the steamy Batavian lowlands, where foreign
elements deteriorate the native stock. The Hotel
Victoria at Soekaboemi consists of detached white
buildings round tree-filled courts, erected on the
"pavilion system." Every two visitors occupy a
tiny bungalow of two bedrooms, opening on a
spacious verandah divided by a screen, and each
section provided with lamp, rocking-chair, and
tea-table, the long public dining hall being
approached by a covered alley. The rain, swishing
down through the night in torrents and cataracts,
clears at sunrise, and though heavy clouds still veil
the heights of Salak, the transparent beauty of the
morning crystallises the atmosphere, and sharply
defines every feature of the landscape. The country
roads, shaded by towering palms and fruit-laden
mangos, glow with a continuous procession of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>brown figures, the women clad in the universal
<i>sarong</i>, but men and children often in Nature's garb,
with touches of orange or crimson in scarf and
turban. Water-oxen and buffaloes, goats and sheep,
vary the throng, but cattle fare badly in fertile Java,
where the all-pervading rice ousts the pasture-land.
Glorious bamboos form arches of feathery green
meeting across the road, and the busy China
<i>campong</i>, or <i>d&eacute;sar</i> in Preanger parlance, is
full of life and movement with the first streak of day,
for all trade in Java depends upon the indefatigable
industry of the Celestial. The idle gambling Malay,
though an expert hunter and fisher, takes no thought
for the morrow, and is protected by the Dutch
Government from ruin by an enforced demand of
rice for storage, according to the numbers of the
family. Every village contains the great Store Barn
of plaited palm leaves, so that, in case of need, the
confiscated rice can be doled out to the improvident
native, who thus contributes to the support of his
family in times of scarcity. This regulation relieves
want without pauperising, the common garner
merely serving as a compulsory savings bank. Many
salutary laws benefit the Malay, possessing a notable
share of tropical slackness, and the lack of initiative
partly due to a servile past under the sway of
tyrannical native princes. The little brown people
of Java, eminently gentle and tractable, are honest
enough for vendors of eatables to place a laden basket
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>at the roadside for the refreshment of the traveller,
who drops a small coin into a bamboo tube fastened
to a tree for this purpose. The customary payment
is never omitted, and at evening the owner of the
basket collects the money, and brings a fresh supply
of food for future wayfarers. Country districts
demonstrate the fact of Java being a creedless land.
This is Sunday, and the Feast of the Epiphany,
but the only honour paid to the day consists in a
gayer garb, and a band playing for an hour in the
palm-shaded garden. Work goes on in rice-field and
plantation, but no church bell rings from the closed
chapel outside the gates, and no sign of religion is
evident, whether from mosque, temple, or church.
Lovely lanes form alluring vistas. The pretty
<i>d&eacute;sas</i> of plaited palm and bamboo, hiding in
depths of tropical woodland, with blue thunbergia
clambering over every verandah, and the Preanger
girls, with their brilliant <i>slandangs</i> of orange and
scarlet, amber and purple, make vivid points of
colour in the foreground of blue mountain and dusky
forest. A copper-coloured boy carries on his head a
basket of gold-fish large as salmon, the westering
sun glittering on the ruddy scales.</p>

<p>Traditional servility remains ingrained in
Preanger character, and the crouching obeisance
known as the <i>dodok</i>, formerly insisted upon, is
still observed by the native to his European masters,
the humble posture giving place to kneeling on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>nearer approach. The kind proprietor of the
Soekaboemi Hotel offers every facility to those
guests anxious to penetrate below the surface of
Soendanese life, placing his carriage and himself at
the disposal of the visitor, and affording a mine of
information otherwise unattainable, for books on
Java are few and far between, and the work of Sir
Stamford Raffles continues the best authority on
island life and customs, though a century has elapsed
since it was written. Why, one asks in amazement,
did England part with this Eastern Paradise? rich
not only in vegetation, but containing unexplored
treasures of precious metal and the vast mineral
wealth peculiar to volcanic regions, where valuable
chemical products are precipitated by the subterranean
forces of Nature's mysterious laboratory. In
the far-off days when "the grand tour" of Europe
was the climax of the ordinary traveller's ambition,
beautiful Java was relinquished on the plea of being
an unknown and useless possession, too far from the
beaten track of British sailing ships to be of practical
value. The remonstrances of Sir Stamford Raffles,
and his representations of future colonial expansion,
were regarded as the dreams of a romantic
enthusiast, and the noble English Governor, in
advance of his age, while effecting during his brief
tenure of office results unattainable by a century of
ordinary labour, found his efforts wasted and his
work undone. Instead of returning home, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>applied himself heroically to the developement of
Singapore, the eternal monument of patriotic
devotion and invincible courage.</p>

<p>The line to Tjandjoer, the starting point
for Sindanglaya, traverses one of the exquisite
plains characteristic of Java. Mountain walls,
with palm-fringed base and violet crest, bound
a fertile expanse, where myriad brooks foam
through fairy arches of feathery bamboo and
long vistas of spreading palm fronds. Rice
in every stage of growth, from flaming green
to softest yellow, covers countless terraces, the
picturesque outlines of their varied contours
enhancing the beauty of the fantastic scene. A
<i>sado</i>, with a team of three tiny ponies, dashes up
the long avenue leading to the palm-fringed hills,
the mighty Amherstia trees forming aisles of dark
green foliage, brightened with the vivid glow of
orange red blossoms. The broad road is a kaleidoscope
of brilliant colour, for native costume vies with
the dazzling tints of tropical Nature as we advance
further into the Preangers. The gay headgear,
worn turbanwise, with two ends standing upright
above plaited folds, and magenta <i>kabajas</i>, with
<i>slandangs</i> of apple green, amber or purple,
make a blaze of colour against the forest background,
or glow amidst the dusky shadows of
palm-thatched sheds, where thirsty travellers imbibe
pink and yellow syrups, the favourite beverages of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>the Malay race. The ascending road commands
superb views of the mountain chain, and the
rambling two-storied hotel, widened by immense
verandahs, stands opposite cloud-crowned Gedeh,
half-veiled by the spreading column of volcanic
smoke. The misty blue of further hills leads the
eye to the three weird peaks of the Tangkoeban
Prahoe, the boat-shaped "Ark" regarded as the
Ararat of Java, for the universal tradition of the
great Deluge underlies the religious history welded
from Moslem, Buddhist, and Hindu elements.
Legendary lore clusters round the petrified "Ark"
in which the progenitors of the Malayan stock
escaped from the Noachian flood. The storm-tossed
and water-logged boat, lodged between jutting rocks,
was reversed that it might dry in the sun, but the
weary voyagers who traditionally peopled the Malay
Archipelago remained in the lotus-eating land, and
the disused "Ark" or <i>Prau</i>, fossilizing through
the ages, became a portion of the peaks whereon it
rested. The sacred mountain developed into a place
of pilgrimage and prayer, and the ruins of richly-carved
temples, together with four broken flights
of a thousand steps, denote the former importance
ascribed to the great Altar of Nature, and the power
of religion on the social life of the past. Generations
of later inhabitants, dwelling in flimsy huts of
bamboo and thatch, regarded the mysterious ruins
of the Tankahan Prahoe as the work of giants or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>demons, and the haunted hill as a mysterious resort
of evil spirits. In lofty Sindanglaya, the swaying
palms of the lowlands yield to glorious tree-ferns,
shading road and ravine with feathery canopies of
velvet green. A lake of azure crystal mirrors a thick
fringe of the great fronds, and on every parapet of
the ruddy cliffs the living emerald of the lanceolated
foliage glows in vivid contrast with the splintered
crags. Sindanglaya is the refuge of fever-stricken
Europeans from malarial coast or inland swamp, but
the hotel is now empty of invalids. The kind
proprietor lavishes time and care on English guests,
and the attentive Malay "room-boys," squatting
on the verandah outside our doors, fear to lose sight
of their charges for a moment, lest some need of
native help should arise. They watch hand and eye
like faithful dogs, for their language is unintelligible
to us as ours to them, and the only attempt at
speech is "<i>Chow-chow, mister!</i>" when the dinner-bell
rings, the mystic words accompanied by a
realistic pantomime of mouth and fingers.</p>

<p>The following morning dawns like an ideal day
of June, and we start in chairs, carried by four
coolies, for the beautiful Falls of Tjibereum. A
mountain road winds through rice-fields and tree-ferns
towards fold upon fold of lilac peaks, until we
reach the mountain garden of Tjibodas, the beautiful
supplement of incomparable Buitenzorg. A strange
sense of remoteness belongs to this lonely pleasaunce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>of the upper world, on a sheltered slope of ever-burning
Gedeh, quiescent now save for the blue curl
of sulphurous smoke, which gives perpetual warning
of those smouldering forces ever ready to devastate
the surrounding country. Subterranean activity
increases during the rainy season, and tremors of
earthquake occasionally startle the equanimity of
those unused to the perils of existence on this thin
crust of Mother Earth, for Java's teeming soil and
population rest upon an ominous fissure of the
globe's surface, and twelve of the forty-five volcanos
on this island of terror and beauty are still
moderately active, sometimes displaying sudden
outbursts of energy. The green lawns and towering
camphor trees of Tjibodas suggest the spellbound
beauty of some enchanted spot, unprofaned by
human foot. A glassy lake mirrors the tall bamboos
and feathery tamarinds, their slender and sensitive
foliage motionless in the still air of the dewy dawn.
Huge coleas accentuate the spring verdure with
heavy masses of bronze and crimson, and magnolias
exhale intoxicating odours from snowy chalices.
Blue lilies and flaxen pampas grass grow in thickets
upon the emerald slopes, and the ordered loveliness
of the mountain Paradise, walled in by dense jungle
and savage precipice, brings the glamour of dreamland
into the stern environment of mysterious forest
and frowning peak. A rudely-paved and mossy
path, shadowed by the black foliage of stately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>casuarinas, leads into the gloomy jungle. The forest
monarchs are curtained with tangled creepers and
roped together with serpent-like lianas, stag-horn
ferns, and green veils of filmy moss fluttering from
every bough. A swampy path through rank grass
and rough boulders pierces the dense thickets,
matted together with inextricable confusion, teak
and tamarind, acacia and bread-fruit, palm and tree-fern
losing their own characteristics and merging
themselves into concrete form. The appalling
stillness and solemnity of the dense jungle appears
emphasised by a solitary brown figure, with pipe and
betel-box, beneath a thatched shed at an angle of
the narrow track, where he presides over a little
stall of cocoanuts, bananas, and coloured syrups, for
the refreshment of coolies on their way from the
Tjibodas garden to villages across the heights of
Gedeh. No voice ever seems raised in these remote
recesses of the mountains, where even the children
of each brown hamlet play silently as figures in a
dream. Our bearers, swishing through wet grass
and splashing across brimming brooks, push with
renewed energies up a steep ascent to the heart of
the wild solitude, where three mighty waterfalls
dash in savage grandeur from a range of over
hanging cliffs into a churning river, descending by
continuous rapids over a stairway of brown-striped
trap-rock and swirling between lichen-clad banks,
to lose itself in the green gloom of the impenetrable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>woods. One of these huge cascades would make the
fortune of a Swiss valley, and we need no further
efforts of our willing bearers in the cause of sight-seeing,
but as neither words nor gestures prove
intelligible to Western obtuseness, a brown coolie
seizes each arm, and rushes us up a grassy hill to a
huge cavern, hung with myriad bats, and containing
a pool of crystal water. The simple minds of these
kindly mountaineers shirk no trouble for the benefit
of the stranger, who, though regarded as a madman,
must be humoured as such, not only to the top of
his bent, but often beyond it. A descent through
rice-fields and <i>d&eacute;sas</i> skirts the serrated cliffs of
Gedeh's northward side, though tree-ferns growing
in thousands afford shelter from the daily showers.
The sudden passion of tropical rain dies away,
leaving an atmosphere of unearthly transparency.
Gedeh, carved in amethyst, leans against a primrose
sky, streaked by the puff of white smoke from the
crater. Villagers returning from work brighten the
road with patches of scarlet and yellow; children,
clad only in necklaces of red seeds and silver bangles,
running about amid groups of women in painted
<i>battek</i>, with brown babies carried in the orange
or crimson folds of the <i>slandang</i>, pause before
the doorways of woven basket-work huts, or carry
crates of yellow bananas and strings of purple
mangosteens, to supplement the "evening rice" of
their frugal meal. The Malay races have been called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>"the flower of the East," noted for their soft voices
and courteous manners in the days of old, but
European intercourse obliterates native characteristics,
and the inhabitant of the sea-coast, or
of the larger towns, unpleasantly imitates the
brusquerie of his Dutch masters, and even exaggerates it.
The Soendanese of the Preanger hills,
less in contact with the external world, retains traces
of life's ancient simplicity, and though a keen
intelligence forms no part of his mental equipment,
his desire to please and satisfy his employer is of
pathetic intensity.</p>

<p>The Governor-General of Java, whose stipend is
of double the amount received by the American
President, owns a country palace at Sindanglaya,
in addition to the splendid official residences at
Batavia and Buitenzorg. A lovely walk leads from
this flower-girt mansion to a pavilion on the Kasoer
hill, commanding a prospect of four mountain
ranges, outlined in tender hues of lavender and
turquoise against the cobalt sky. In the foreground
stretches a fertile plain, with bamboo and sugar-cane
varying the eternal rice in brilliant shades of green
and gold, always decorative, from the first emerald
blade to the amber-tinted straw, for the sacred
grain possesses a beauty far exceeding that of wheat,
barley, or rye.</p>

<p>Undulating lines and ascending terraces break
the uniformity of the lovely plains with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>fascination of weird contour and fanciful design,
intricate as the pattern traced on the native <i>sarong</i>.
The rice-culture of these fields and valleys is a
perfect survival of the primeval system, unchanged
since the days when "the gift of the gods" was
first bestowed on primitive man in this land of
plenty. The peasant, toiling in the flooded
<i>sawas</i>, and occupied from seedtime to harvest
in the arduous labour demanded by the rice-field,
combines with his agricultural work the idea of a
sacred duty to the divinities who gave him the
staple commodity whereon his life mainly depends.
Cocoanut and sugar-cane, maize and tapioca, banana
and cassava, supplement the rice, but it ranks above
all other products of the teeming soil, for sacramental
efficacy and supernatural origin have
hallowed the "grain of heaven" from the very
dawn of history, and the hereditary belief in the
efficacy of the sacred crop still remains mystically
rooted in the sub-consciousness of the Malay race.</p>

<h3>GAROET AND HER VOLCANO.</h3>


<p>The occasional drawback of weeping skies is
counterbalanced by the gorgeous vegetation only
seen to perfection in the rainy season, and that
clouds should sometimes veil the burning blue to
mitigate Equatorial sunshine proves a source of
satisfaction to those who fail to appreciate the Rip
Van Winkle life of womankind in Java. The
journey to Garoet supplies a succession of vivid
pictures, illustrating the individuality of the insular
scenery. The weird outlines of volcanic ranges,
shading from palest azure to deepest plum-colour,
the dreamlike beauty of Elysian plains, and the
stately palm-forests extending league upon league,
with mighty vans clashing in the mountain breeze,
assume magical charm as we penetrate into the
heart of the alluring land. Two pyramidal peaks,
Haroeman and Kaleidon, rise sheer from the fair
plain of Lel&eacute;s in colossal stairways of green rice-terraces.
Knots of palm shelter innumerable
villages which dot the mountain flanks, the woven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>huts fragile as houses of cards, but built up on
identical sites through countless ages, recorded in
perennial characters of living green on these twin
trophies of primitive agriculture. Many travellers
have commented on the strange undertone of music,
echoing from a thousand silvery rills and tiny
cascades, which follow the verdant lines of terrace
or parapet, and make the shimmering air vocal with
melody, like the distant song of surf on a coral reef.
Variety of form belongs to all Javanese agriculture
as the result of handicraft, for the peasant
unconsciously puts his own personality into his toil.
The exquisite tints of the rice in different stages of
growth display a translucence indescribable except
in terms of light and fire. The amber gleam of
young shoots, the green flames of the springing
crop, the pulsating emerald of later growth, and the
golden sheen of ripened ears, invest the "gift of the
gods" with unearthly radiance. The Eastern mind
has ever responded to Nature's touch, for the great
Mother whispers her closest secrets to simple hearts,
and science now realises that civilisation has broken
many of the subtle links which in earlier days were
mystic bonds of union between man and the
universe.</p>

<p>Malay idiosyncracy evidences the survival of
many primal influences forgotten or denied by races
of higher type and deeper culture. Very little is
known concerning the Malayan people who mingled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>with almost every Oriental stock. Amphibious
tastes suggest picturesque traditions of prolonged
voyaging in search of fresh fishing grounds to supply
the needs of a rapidly multiplying population. A
strong Malay element exists even in far-off Japan,
and the wide ramifications of the nomadic stock can
be traced to broad rivers encountered on the southward
journey, and luring stragglers from the main
body by the mysterious glamour of winding water-ways
piercing the tangled forests, and pointing to
unknown realms of hope or promise. The Malay
retains many of the hereditary gifts bestowed on
the untaught children of Nature, and, in spreading
his language and customs far over the vast Pacific,
adopted few extraneous ideas from the world through
which he wandered. His primeval instincts still
sway his life under other conditions. Marvellous
skill in hunting, fishing, boat-building, and navigation
in tornado-swept waters, remains to him. The
deft weaving of palm-leaf hut and wall of defence
creates a village or destroys it at lightning speed.
Even now his basket-work home is never built on
dry land, if water can be found wherein to plant the
supporting poles of the fragile dwellings, suggesting
the impermanence of a nomadic race. The Malay
never travels on foot to any place which can possibly
be reached by water, his native element; winds
and tides have imbued him with something of their
own unstable and changing character, and the sea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>which nurtured him is still the supreme factor in
his life. Feet vie with fingers in marvellous
capacity, and to see a native cocoanut gatherer run
up the polished stem of a swaying palm, with greater
ease and swiftness than anyone shows in mounting a
ladder, transports thought to the distant past, when
the ancestral stock, disembarking from the rude
canoes at nightfall, sought an evening meal on the
edge of the palm-forest, bowed beneath the weight
of green and yellow nuts a hundred feet overhead.
What wonder if in lands of perpetual summer the
syren song of some "long bright river" should lure
the storm-tossed mariners from the perilous seas
to the comparative security of inland life! The
stern environment of Northern poverty stands out
in terrible contrast with the teeming prodigality of
tropical Nature, offering all the richest fruits of
earth in full measure to these early wanderers
across the Southern seas.</p>

<p>The mountain railway, curving round ridge
or precipice and spanning sombre gorge with
bridge and aqueduct, affords superb views of
the unrivalled plains. Waterfalls foam over
granite cliffs; a sinuous river flings a silver
chain round the symmetrical base of Kaleidon, and
from our lofty vantage point we gaze into the
luminous green of a million palms, where the warm
heart of a deep forest opens to display the lustre
and colour of molten emeralds. The Soendanese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>quarter of the island gives place to the ancient
Javanese territory, and Malay characteristics, though
underlying and mingling with every insular stock,
are here modified by a strain of Hindu ancestry,
which gives refinement of feature and grace of
carriage. Well-modelled figures and delicate hands
and feet are attributed to the liberal admixture of
royal and noble blood with that of the peasantry,
for the ancient Rulers of Java respected no rights
but their own, and the domestic arrangements of
King Solomon prevailed in a kingdom of tyrants
and slaves. Hindu thraldom was intensified under
Arab priests, who, following in the train of piratical
Moormen, claimed the sovereignty of Java under
their protection. The gold-embroidered jacket of
civil or military rank, with the <i>kris</i> thrust into
a brilliant sash, here supplements the universal
<i>sarong</i>, itself of bolder design and glowing colour
in this old-world realm of Mataram, the centre of
Java's historic interest. The crooked blade of the
<i>kris</i> is still used in divination, light and shadow
playing over the wavy steel, ever suggesting
cabalistic signs inscribed by an invisible hand on
the azure surface. The <i>kris</i> is popularly endowed
with healing efficacy, and the availing touch of the
sacred talisman is an article of Javanese faith. A
hundred varieties of the weapon are found in
the Malay Archipelago, from the gold-hilted and
diamond-studded royal <i>kris</i> to the boat-handled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>dagger of common use, permitted to all but peasants;
women of the higher class wear it in the girdle, and
though unrepresented in the sculpture of Javanese
temples, the <i>kris</i> is ascribed to the days of Panji, a
Hindu warrior whose feats form the libretto of
a popular drama, though his authenticity appears
uncertain. The changes in local costume and
character, as seen in wayside villages, enliven the
journey until we reach the mountain gateway of
Tjadas Pangeran, "the Royal Stone," flanked by
flashing waterfalls, and forming the entrance to the
region supreme in natural scenery, archaic art, and
literary interest. The black cone of Goentoer, "the
thunder peak," accentuates the red blaze of the
declining sun on the intricate rice-mosaic of green
and gold in the divinely beautiful plain revealed
through the rocky cleft. Amid the many glories of
Javanese landscape, the poetic glamour of these
palm-girt levels lingers longest in the memory, for
the world-famed picture known as "The Plains of
Heaven" might have been inspired by the haunting
loveliness of these rolling uplands. Our railway
carriage contains a native Regent, his principal wife,
and a pretty daughter. Javanese princes are made
ostensible rulers of native districts, but associated
with Dutch Residents as "Elder Brothers," who
may be more accurately termed compulsory advisers.
Without a measure of despotic authority exercised
by the fraternal partner, the spendthrift Malay
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>would cause perpetual hindrance to insular development
and commercial prosperity. The old Regent,
with embroidered military jacket glittering above his
elaborately-patterned <i>sarong</i>, looks a grim and forbidding
figure, and evidently regards his womenkind
as beneath notice. His head is tied up in a black
kerchief, and a brilliant Order conferred by the
Queen of Holland adorns his breast. Madame, in
magenta shawl and purple gown, travesties
European costume. Diamonds blaze incongruously
on arms and neck, a scarlet flower in oily black
braids completing her startling attire. The girl, in
yellow <i>sarong</i> and pink cotton jacket glorified with
rubies and pearls, shows her high breeding in
slender wrists, delicate hands, and bare feet of
exquisite modelling, a red stain of henna drawing
attention to their statuesque contour. She staggers
beneath a load of impedimenta belonging to her
princely father: bags, bundles, and a heavy cloak.
Javanese parents of exalted rank treat their
daughters with disdain, the approved discipline of
family life consisting in stamping an impression of
abject insignificance deeply on the plastic mind of
girlhood. Fertile plain and wooded slopes are alike
destitute of domestic animals. The sheep was
unknown to native races in this pastureless land,
and, though introduced by the earliest colonists, is
still spoken of as "the Dutch goat," no other term
existing for it in Malay parlance. Monkeys
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>chatter and rustle in forest trees, gorgeous birds flit
past on jewelled wings, and frogs in this rainy
season make a deep booming like the tuning of
numerous violoncellos. At length the little town of
Garoet appears in a green valley, encircled by a
diadem of peaks which suggest a tropical Engadine.
Volcanic mountains replace Alpine crests, but the
white battlements of Papandayang's smoking crater
give the effect of distant snow, and the dark pines
of the Swiss valley are merely translated into the
lustrous green of crowding palms. Brawling river,
rustic bridge, and brown hamlets foster the strange
illusion, and if it be true that somewhere in the
wide world every face finds a counterpart, natural
scenery may be subject to an identical law, and
various ice-bound landscapes be mirrored under
Southern skies in pictures wreathed with palm-fronds
and tropic flowers. The Hotel Rupert,
garlanded with creepers, the open lattices trellised
with ivy and roses, shows a more poetic aspect than
any hostelry of the distant Engadine. Our hostess
is the widow of a German physician, and her fair
young daughter, alert and capable as the typical
<i>Hausfrau</i> of her native land, has established a
reputation for supplying the guests with the home
comforts and restful atmosphere which make the
Hotel Rupert an ideal abiding-place in stagnant
Java, where as a rule the sole luxuries are out-of-doors,
and of Nature's providing. That the Dutchman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
flourishes on his diet of tinned meat, his
appalling rice-table, and the extraordinary sequence
of dishes which probably belonged to the early days
of colonisation, either proves herculean strength or
the triumph of mind over matter, but to those of
less heroic mould the unwonted amenities of a more
familiar civilisation are welcome as a green oasis in
a sandy desert. A cool and healthy mountain
climate gives unwonted zest for the lovely excursions
of which Garoet is the centre. From the little lake
Setoe Bajendit, a covered raft plies to a cupola-crowned
hill, facing a noble panorama of volcanic
peaks the Soendanese <i>d&eacute;sa</i> of basket-work huts,
through which we pass, presents a curious spectacle,
with the village street lined on either side by rows
of kneeling children, clad in Dame Nature's brown
suit alone; each little figure holding up a long-stemmed
flower&mdash;red hybiscus, creamy tuberose, or
snowy gardenia&mdash;the imploring faces raised in silent
entreaty to the white strangers for the infinitesimal
coins which suffice to purchase a sheaf of blossom.
Changing lights and shadows sweep across the
glancing emerald of the rice-filled vale, darken the
purple rifts of mountain gorges, or intensify the
luminous azure of soaring crests. Wayside fruit-stalls
make gay patches of colour among green piles
of banana leaves, and thin yellow strips of bamboo,
the approved paper and string of the tropics, in
which every parcel is packed. Tall sugar-cane and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>plumy maize surround each brown <i>d&eacute;sa</i> beneath
the knot of palms, and fields of tapioca vary the
prevailing rice-grounds with sharp-pointed leaves
and paler verdure. The entire tapioca crop of Java
belongs to Huntley and Palmer, for use in the
manufacture of the biscuits which make a valuable
supplement to the Javanese commissariat, for
unlimited rice seldom commends itself to English
tastes. Hot springs abound in this volcanic soil,
and in the "five waters" of Tjipanas, each of
different temperature, the native finds a panacea
wherein he can indulge to his heart's content, the
healing springs rushing into stone tanks set in sheds
of bamboo. The principal excursion from Garoet
is to the active crater of the Papandayang, a long
drive of twelve miles leading to the foot of the
volcano. From this point a chair carried by six
coolies is required for the steep road, formed by
hundreds of moss-grown steps. Plantations of
coffee, cinchona, and tapioca girdle the lower slopes
of the mountain, hedges and thickets of red and
purple coleas bordering the primeval jungle of
orchid-decked trees on the higher levels, the moss-grown
boughs wreathed with epiphytal plants, the
trunks covered with branching ferns, and the thick
ropes of matted lianas strangling the dense forest
in their green embrace. Wild oleander mingles rosy
blossoms with bushes of living gold like tall growths
of double buttercups, and at length the cooler regions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>show the familiar ferns, violets, and primroses of
the temperate zone. The weird silence of the jungle
is emphasised by an occasional cry of a wild bird,
flitting among the tall tree tops, or the crash of a
bough, dragged down by the weight of some climbing
rattan. A walk up a boulder-strewn slope reaches
the old crater, or Solfatara, almost surrounded by
steep walls of rock. Boiling and wheezing springs,
fast-forming sulphur columns, and clouds of choking
steam, rise from the yellow and orange-powdered
earth. A deafening noise issues from the self-building
architecture of ruddy pillars, the bubbling
of boiling mud, and the shrill spouting of hot vapours
from narrow orifices in the trembling crust of the
fire-charged earth. Golden sulphur-pools shower
burning drops on every side, and from the
mysterious <i>kawa</i> or crater, echoes of subterranean
thunder sound at intervals, from the
traditional forge where native legends assert that
a chained giant is condemned to work eternally
in the service of the Evil One.</p>

<p>At night the broad verandah of the Hotel Rupert
is transformed into a stage for a performance of
the <i>topeng</i> or national drama, chartered by an
American guest. The weird spectacle, accompanied
by the <i>gamelon</i> music, transports us to the days of
old-world Java, story and performance being of
ancient origin and religious signification. The
subjects of the <i>topeng</i> are derived from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Panji group of dramatic poems, the ancient
costumes, the curious masks, and the office of the
<i>dalang</i> or reciter, whose ventriloquial skill is
required for the entire wording of the <i>libretto</i>,
comprise a valuable memento of bygone days,
otherwise entirely forgotten. The <i>wayang-wayang</i>
or "shadow dance" of puppets, vies with the
<i>topeng</i> in popularity, but the latter ranks as
classic and lyrical drama. A graceful girl in pink,
with floating scarf, and gleaming <i>kris</i> in her
spangled sash, exhibits wonderful skill in the supple
play of wrist and fingers, through the process known
as devitalization, a form of drill which gives to
the arm a plastic power of detached movement,
fascinating but uncanny. The dusky garden is
filled with a native crowd, moved alternately to
tears and laughter by exploits unintelligible to the
European spectator, for the story of every national
hero is known to the poorest and most ignorant of
the people, from perpetual attendance on theatrical
performances. The <i>al fresco</i> entertainments
necessitated by the climate provide exceptional
opportunities of dramatic education in the legends
of Java's heroic age. The spacious verandahs
gleaming with the soft light of Chinese lanterns,
and set in depths of shadow, the scented gloom of
the tropical night veiling the dusky lawns, crowded
with mysterious figures drawn by the weird music
from every quarter, the brilliant robes and grotesque
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>masks of the actors, compose a picture of archaic
charm. Passers-by pause on their way to look, and
listen with unwearied interest to the oft-told tales,
for the stories of the world's childhood, like the fairy
lore of our own early days, deepen their significance
to the untaught mind by perpetual repetition. The
Hindu cloudland which veils the Javanese past
"was reached by a ladder of realities," for the
exploits of gods and mythical heroes were afterwards
attributed to native Rulers, until the medley of truth
and fiction, history and mythology, became an
inextricable tangle. The birds' beaks, and hooked
noses of the masks in the <i>topeng</i>, and of the
puppets in the shadow-play, were made compulsory
after the Arabic conquest, in order to reconcile the
national pastime with the creed of Islam, which
forbade the dramatic representation of the human
form. The reigning <i>Susunhan</i> evaded the decree
by distorting mask and puppet, but although
the outside world might no longer recognise the
heroes of the play, Javanese knowledge of national
tradition easily pierced the flimsy disguise, and
credited their deified heroes with a new power of
metamorphosis. The fantastic play lasts so far into
the night that the prolonged <i>libretto</i> is brought to a
summary conclusion by the hostess, since European
nature can stand no more, though the rapt attention
of the Malay would continue till morning. The
satiety of modern days has never touched these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>simple minds, and an entire absence of that critical
element which disintegrates so many of life's simple
joys, ministers to the supreme satisfaction derived
from the crude ideals of native drama. Silently the
brown spectators slip away like shadows from the
dim and dewy garden, for the simple and untaught
Malay, though eagerly welcoming the privileges
permitted to him, never encroaches upon them, and
the conduct of these Eastern playgoers affords an
example of order and sobriety which shames many
an audience of higher education and social superiority
in distant Europe.</p>

<h3>DJOKJACARTA.</h3>


<p>A long day's journey lies between Garoet and
Djokjacarta, which popular parlance abbreviates
into Djokja. From the blue Preanger hills and
palm-shadowed upland plains, the railway descends
by steep gradients to the dense jungle and fever-laden
swamp known as the Terra Ingrata.
Malarious mists steam from marsh and mere, pink
and purple lantana, yellow daisies, and the pallid
blossoms of strangling creepers emphasise the gloom
of the matted foliage, forming an impenetrable
screen on either side of the narrow embankment
across the dreary morass. The railway through the
hundred miles of this miasma-haunted region was
laid at immense sacrifice of human life, even the
native workmen being compelled to sleep in camps
far away from the scene of their daily toil. No white
man could even direct the work, and the ubiquitous
Chinaman, proof against every ill that flesh is heir
to in Java, was deputed to superintend the solution
of abstruse professional problems, between the short
and hasty visits of Dutch and English engineers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Quagmire and quicksand, stagnant pool and sluggish
stream, succeed in weary iteration. Bleached
skeletons of dead trees writhe in weird contortions
against the dark background of jungle, as though
some wizard's curse had blighted life and growth
amid the rank vegetation rising from this dismal
Slough of Despond. The brooding melancholy of
atmosphere and scenery penetrates mind and soul,
oppressed by an intangible weight, and escape
from the Dantesque horrors of this <i>selva oscura</i> is
accompanied by a sudden relief and buoyancy of
spirit which perceptibly heightens the interest of the
old-world city, once isolated by the woodland
fastness of Nature, and belonging to an ageless past,
surrounding the authentic origin of Djokjacarta
with thick clouds of fable and myth. The modern
name is derived from Arjudja, a city recorded in
Java's ancient annals as being established by Rama,
the incarnate Sun-God. Na-yud-ja, the first king
of this Divinely-founded capital, also memorialises
in his name the place which became the nucleus of
the ancient Hindu empire. Temples and palaces,
walls and watch-towers, ruined by earthquake,
buried in jungle, and blackened by smoke of war,
testify to the splendours of old Mataram. A bitter
resistance was offered by the invading hordes of
Islam, whether pirates or prophets, princes or
soldiers, and the Hindu territory remained independent
until the fierce conflict in the 18th century with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>usurping Mohammedans and Dutch colonists, when
family influence was undermined by political
intrigues. The Dutch, after many vicissitudes,
became absolute rulers of Java, though native
princes, as tributaries, were suffered to retain a
semblance of sovereignty. The shadowy paraphernalia
of vanished power is still accorded to the
Sultan of Djokjacarta, in melancholy travesty of
past authority, though every hereditary privilege
has been wrested from his grasp. A curious relic
of primitive days remains in the <i>al fresco</i> Throne of
Judgment, a block of stone beneath a rudely-tiled
canopy, moss-grown and hoary. Two ancient
waringen-trees, their aerial roots, drooping branches,
and colossal main trunks denoting an almost fabulous
age, flank the historic seat, where the turbaned
Ruler administered justice to the surging crowd
which thronged around him, the indigo garb of
the Soendanese contrasting with the gay <i>sarongs</i> of
Central Java, glowing in the hot sunlight as it
poured through the dark trellis of fluttering boughs.
The city in the course of ages moved away from
this ancient centre, and the rustic Throne is now
remote from the heart of civic life. The streets of
Djokjacarta, and the surrounding roads, consist of
shady avenues, where open <i>tokos</i> (the native
shops) vary the monotony of Dutch villas, their
white colonnades and porticos gleaming against the
background of stately trees, and rising from a mass
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>of tropical vegetation. The prevailing indigo of
Soendanese dress gives a dull aspect to the wide but
squalid streets, for in native capitals, though Dutch
cleanliness may enforce perpetual "tidying up," the
lacking sense of order produces a strange impermanence
in the conditions insisted upon. The inner
court of the Sultan's Kraton, or Royal Enclosure,
is now taboo to visitors, for the barbaric monarch,
on the plea of age and infirmity, has obtained the
privilege of privacy, and the Palace can only be seen
through a personal interview. The outer courts are
accessible to carriages, which make the square-mile
circuit of the spacious quadrangles. Massive gates
and crumbling machicolated walls command a green
plain, where immense waringen-trees, clipped into
the semblance of evergreen umbrellas, display the
Eastern symbol of sovereignty. Officials passing to
and fro show a continuous procession of these State
<i>pajongs</i>. The Sultan's august head is canopied
with gold, edged by an orange stripe, the Crown
Prince sporting an umbrella with a golden border.
Sultanas and royal children are known by white
<i>pajongs</i>, while the vast concourse of Court
officials, with umbrellas of pink, blue, red, black,
purple and green, show their status to the initiated
eye through the sequence of colour by which the
<i>pajongs</i> form a complete system of heraldry.
In the dusky angle of a mossy wall, four elephants,
used in State processions, feed upon bundles of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>bamboo and sugar-cane. Mud huts and bamboo
sheds prop themselves against tiled eaves and
windowless houses. Open doors afford glimpses of
squalid interiors, crowded with slatternly women
and dirty children, the hereditary retainers and
hangers-on of this effete and moribund royalty.
Private troupes of dancing <i>bedayas</i>, <i>gamelon</i>
players, actors, pipe, fan, and betel-box bearers,
pertain to the tumbledown Palace, and the patriarchal
system of ancient Java permits the presence
of whole families belonging to these indispensable
ministers of the royal pleasure. The people show
the same indifference to Mohammedanism as to the
perished faiths of olden time, and a large funeral
party encountered on leaving the Kraton displays
painful irreverence, though scattering rice and
lighting incense sticks before a white coffin borne
shoulder-high, and decked with a tracery of yellow
marigolds and rosettes of pink paper. No priest
accompanies the procession, and the laughter of the
white-scarved mourners, preceded by men carrying
ropes and planks, suggests an utter heartlessness
and barbarity. Gay <i>passers</i>, a busy <i>campong
Tchina</i>, a very hive of Celestial industry, and
innumerable drives beneath over-arching trees, with
distant views of purple peaks, comprise the interests
of old-world Djokja, with the one exception of the
famous Taman Sarie, or Water Castle, ruined by
earthquake, but remaining as a pathetic memorial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>of bygone power and pride. Pavilions and baths,
grottoes and fish-ponds, set in the tangled verdure
of a neglected garden, surround the arcaded parapets
of a colossal tower. Green plumes of fern wave
from wall and battlement, velvet moss and orange
lichen tapestry the blackened stone, and matted
creepers sway their woven curtains in the evening
wind. A Dancing Hall, which formerly rang with
the weird music accompanying the "woven paces
and waving hands" of Court <i>bedayas</i>, in their
spangled pink robes, now echoes to the tread of
alien feet; the dim arcades teem with ghostly
memories, and the mournful desolation of the Taman
Sarie borrows fresh poignancy in the former scene
of mirth and music. A moss-grown and slippery
stairway leads to the green twilight of a subterranean
grotto, containing the richly-carved stone bedstead
of the Sultan, who sought this cool retreat from the
ardour of a tropical sun. A silvery curtain of
murmuring water fell before his sculptured couch,
and supplied this haunt of dreams with an ideal,
if rheumatic environment of poetic beauty and
lulling charm. Superstition clings to the deserted
resting-place, and to touch even the stone columns
of the royal couch is to invoke the powers of
evil, and the presence of Death. The <i>Sumoor
Gamelon</i>, or "Musical Spring," echoing with the
voice of flowing waters, flanks the ancient
banqueting hall, and cools a circle of vaulted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>grottoes, their shadowy depths bathed in the
emerald twilight, deepened by the veil of verdure
and the transparent foliage drooping over open
window spaces. The Sultan's oval bathing tank,
with stone galleries and spiral pavilions, occupies a
hollow tower, but a touch of young life dispels the
gloom, for a group of brown children swim and
dive in the cool depths, shouting and splashing with
a merriment unsubdued by the solemn sadness of
the deserted halls. A Portuguese architect designed
this fantastic retreat for an old-time Sultan, who
brought the idea of the Water Castle from a far-off
Indian home. The earthquake of 1867 rendered
the Taman Sarie uninhabitable, choked the lake in
which it stood, and destroyed the subaqueous
tunnel which ensured the absolute seclusion of
Sultan and harem. The famous Marshal Daendels,
weary of waiting for an interview with a dilatory
Sultan, yielded to natural impatience, and hearing
the sound of distant music from the watery depths,
dashed through the thicket of tamarinds which
concealed the entrance to the water pavilion, and,
dragging the Sultan from the place of dreams,
scattered <i>bedayas</i> and <i>gamelon</i> players in terror,
forcing the so-called "Regent of the World" and
"Shadow of the Almighty" to accompany him
to the Dutch headquarters. Rose garden and
shrubbery, palm grove and pleasaunce, are fast
relapsing into impenetrable jungle. Broken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>fountains, and mouldering vases once filled with
orange-trees, outline the balustraded terraces; gilt
pavilions lift their upcurved eaves above a wild
growth of oleander, but the enchanted scene of old
romance is given up to bats and lizards, for the
crumbling Taman Sarie is now a fast-vanishing
monument of Java's buried past.</p>

<p>The number of <i>rechas</i>, or sacred stone figures
of Brahmin and Buddhist origin, in the garden of
the Dutch Residency, shows the scant care bestowed
on the ancient temples, for years used as mere
quarries of broken statuary, and still receiving inadequate
recognition as historical remains, though Sir
Stamford Raffles a century ago realised the supreme
importance of Javanese sculpture as an indispensable
link in arch&aelig;ological science. Djokjacarta,
interesting in itself as the survival of an ancient
dynasty, borrows double attraction from the architectural
wonders which surround it, buried for ages
in the deep green grave of tropical vegetation, but
now laid bare as an open book, wherein we may read
those graven records which unveil the mysteries of
the past, and enable us to gaze down the long vista
of Time and Change.</p>

<h3>BORO-BOEDOER.</h3>


<p>The arch&aelig;ological interest of Java culminates in
the mysterious temple known as Boro-Boedoer,
"the aged thing," with an actual history lost in
mist and shadow, though recorded in imperishable
characters on this spellbound sanctuary of a
departed faith. The little tramway from Djokjacarta
traverses fields of rice and sugar-cane, indigo and
pepper; a range of dreamlike mountains bounds the
view, crowned by the turquoise cone of Soemboeung,
the traditional centre of Java, a green knoll at the
base of the volcanic pyramid being regarded as the
"spike" which fastens the floating isle to some
solid rock in unfathomed depths of ocean. The
fitful fancy of a wandering race, ever drifting across
the changing seas, reflects itself in the legendary
lore of the Malay Archipelago, often represented by
weird traditions as though in perpetual motion.
The vicissitudes of volcanic action, whereby islands
were sometimes submerged or created, gives a
colouring of fact to the vague ideas entertained by
these nomads of the sea. Merbaboe, the "ash-ejecting,"
and Merapi, the "fire-throwing," flank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>the loftier crest, honeycombed with dim cave
temples, now deserted and forgotten, but formerly
sanctifying those watch-towers of Nature which
guard the hoary shrine of Boro-Boedoer. At
Matoelan we hear that the swift river separating
the great Temple from the secular world is in flood,
the bridge broken down, and the supplementary raft
impossible through the swirling current. This
untoward event involves a further expedition to
Magelang, a sordid town of continuous markets, the
Javanese population being of pronounced Hindu
type, silent and sad, according to the idiosyncracy
of their mysterious ancestors across the sea. The
conversational difficulties presented by the Dutch
and Malay languages, combined with the incapacity
of our brown driver, eventually land us at Mendoet,
on the wrong side of the turbid stream&mdash;the Jordan
which divides the weary traveller from his Land of
Promise. Evening draws on, the clear sky flushes
pink above the darkness of the palm-woods, and
hope sinks apace, for the surging flood shows no
sign of abatement. Suddenly the apathetic driver
rouses himself from what proves a profitable meditation,
and, with folded hands, breathes the magic
word <i>pasteur</i>, whipping up his sorry steeds to
fresh exertions. We draw up at a white bungalow
on the roadside, close to a rustic church, and find a
friend in an English-speaking Dutch priest, who,
after giving us tea on his verandah, suggests
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>inspection of Mendoet's little moated temple, on the
edge of the forest. An ever-growing tangle of lianas
and vines buried this ancient shrine through the
lapse of ages, until accident revealed the entombed
sanctuary about eighty years ago. A processional
terrace surrounds the walled pavement supporting
the grey edifice, and the sculptured bas-reliefs
denote the transitional stage of Buddhist faith, as it
materialised through Jainism into the Puranic
mythology of Hindu creed. The central chapel
contains the famous picture in stone known as "The
Tree of Knowledge," and represents the Buddha
beneath the sacred Bo-Tree of Gaya. A fluted
<i>pajong</i>, propped against the boughs, canopies
his head, one hand being raised in benediction
over kneeling converts, offering rice and incense.
Listening angels hover overhead, birds peep out
from nests among the leaves, and kids lean with
necks outstretched over fretted crags, magnetised by
the mystic attraction of the inspired Teacher.
Long-eared statues show Nepalese influence, even
the Buddhist images being girt with the sacred cord
of Brahma. A controversy exists as to their
identification with the Hindu Trinity, but as
Eastern cults frequently bestow Divine attributes
on mortals, the mysterious figures may possibly
represent the murdered wives of the Rajah who
founded the Mendoet temple in expiation of his
crime. Another legend suggests the petrification
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>of a princely family, as a punishment for marrying
within the forbidden degrees, but myth grows apace
in this haunted land, and every century offers fresh
variations of old-world stories, until original form
is lost beneath a weight of accretion, like the thick
moss blurring the chiselled outlines of some carven
monument. After careful scrutiny of the miniature
temple which suggests so many interpretations of
symbolic imagery, we return to the little presbytery
to hear of the subsiding river, and the good priest,
announcing that the raft can now be safely
negotiated, accompanies us to the tottering structure,
a straw matting laid over three crazy boats
punted across the turbulent stream. A half-hour's
stroll beneath the arching boughs of a kanari avenue,
ends at a picturesque Rest House, facing the temple-crowned
hill. Surely we have reached the peace
and silence of Nirvana at last! and the exquisite
beauty of the surrounding landscape, mountain and
forest, park-like valley and winding glen, transfigured
in the deepening gold of sunset, stamps an
ineffaceable impression of Boro-Boedoer in that
mystic gallery of imagination and memory which
retains earth's fairest scenes as eternal possessions
of mind and soul. A shadowy garden, fragrant and
dim, stretches up to the pyramidal pile which covers
the hill. A frangipanni grove scents the air, with
gold-starred blossoms gleaming whitely amid the
silvery green of lanceolated leaves, and a shaft of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>ruby light striking the stone Buddhas which guard
the portico, emphasises the inscrutable smile of the
tranquil faces. Like all stupendous monuments of Art
or Nature, Boro-Boedoer at first sight seems a disappointment,
simply because the mind fails to grasp
the immensity of the noblest Temple ever dedicated
to the gentle Sage whose renunciation typified the
greater Sacrifice offered by the Saviour of the World.
Who that reads the story of Sakya Munyi can doubt
that through the Prince who gave up kingdom,
throne, and earthly ties for the sake of downtrodden
humanity, a prophetic gleam of heavenly
light pierced the darkness of the future, and pointed
to the distant Cross? Twenty-five centuries have
rolled away since Prince Siddartha closed his unique
career, and twelve centuries later the wondrous sanctuary
of Boro-Boedoer was erected in honour of the
creed eternally dear to the heart of the mystic East.
The eight stately terraces which climb and encircle
the sacred hill rise from a spacious pavement of
blackened stone, and the walled processional paths
display a superb series of sculptured reliefs, which
would measure three miles in length if placed side
by side. The grey and black ruins, with their rich
incrustations of sacred and historic scenes, remain
in such splendid preservation that fancy easily
reconstructs the bygone glory of the golden age,
when this mighty Altar of Faith witnessed the
glittering pageantry of Oriental devotion; when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>gaily-clad crowds flocked to the morning sacrifice of
flowers and music, while monarchs brought their
treasures from far-off lands to lay at the feet of the
mystic Sage, prophetically revealed as an incarnation
of purity and peace vouchsafed to a world of
oppression and sorrow. Life-size Buddhas, enthroned
on the sacred lotus, rise above the crumbling
altars of five hundred arcaded shrines, and stone
stairways ascend from every side, beneath sharply-curved
arches bordered with masks or gargoyles.
The last three terraces form sweeping circles,
flanked by bell-shaped <i>dagobas</i> resembling gigantic
lotus-buds. Each open lattice of hoary stone
reveals an enthroned Buddha, mysteriously enclosed
in his symbolical screen, for these triple terraces
typify the higher circles of Nirvana. Each dreamy
face turns towards the supreme Shrine of the
glorious sanctuary, a domed <i>dagoba</i> fifty feet high,
and once containing some authentic relic of the
Buddha's sacred person. Certain arch&aelig;ologists
recognise in this spire-tipped cupola a survival
of Nature-worship, incorporated with the later
Buddhism in a form derived from the tree temples
of primeval days, and built over a receptacle for the
cremated ashes of the Buddhist priesthood. A touch
of mysticism added by an unfinished statue in the
gloom of the shadowy vault, suggests the unknown
beauty of the soul which attains Nirvana's supremest
height, for the supernal exaltation of purified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>humanity to Divine union may not be interpreted or
expressed by mortal hands, but must for ever remain
incommunicable and incomprehensible. From the
central <i>dagoba</i>, ascended by a winding stair, the
intricate design of the spacious sanctuary discloses
itself with mathematical precision, and the changing
glories of dawn, sunset, and moonlight idealize the
sacred hill, rising amid the palm-groves and rice-fields
of a matchless valley, sweeping away in green
undulations which break like emerald waves against
the deepening azure and amethyst of the mountain
heights. The solemn grandeur of Boro-Boedoer
blinds the casual observer to many details which
manifest the ravages of time, the ruthlessness of
war, and the decay of a discarded creed. Headless
and overthrown figures, broken <i>tees</i>, mutilated
carvings, and shattered chapels abound, but the vast
display of architectural features still intact conveys
an impression of permanence rather than of ruin.</p>

<p>For six centuries, Boro-Boedoer was blotted from
the memory of the people, and the heavy pall of
tropical verdure which veiled the vast Temple
remained unlifted. Superincumbent masses of trees,
parasites, and strangling creepers wove their intricate
network of root, branch, and stem round the
monumental record of a dead faith and a buried
dynasty. The riotous luxuriance of tropical Nature
triumphed over the glories of Art, hewn with
incalculable toil and skill in the living rock. Seeds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>borne on the wind, or sown by wandering birds,
filled every interstice of the closely-matted verdure;
stair and terrace, dome and spire, sank out of sight
into the forest depths, and when English engineers
arrived to excavate the monumental pile, the task
of clearing away the tangled masses of foliage
occupied two hundred coolies during six weeks of
arduous toil. The brief English occupation of the
island necessarily left the work unfinished, but
Dutch arch&aelig;ologists continued the labour, though
with slower methods and feebler grasp of the
situation. A transient cult sprang up among the
Javanese populace as the ancient sanctuary revealed
itself anew. The statues were invoked with
reverential awe, incense was offered; the saffron,
used as a personal decoration on festive occasions,
was smeared over the impassive faces, unchanged
in the eternal calm of a thousand years, and
fragrant flower petals were heaped on the myriad
altars. Vigils were kept on the summit, and the
sick were laid at the feet of favourite images. This
spurious devotion, hereditary or instinctive, sprang
up in responsive hearts with simultaneous fervour,
though the forgotten doctrines of Buddhism were
never reinstated. Sentiment survived dogma in the
subconscious soul, and the faint shadow cast by an
immemorial past indicates the depths plumbed by
the early creed in the abyss of Eastern personality.
The vague simulacrum quickly faded, like a flickering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>flame in the wind which fanned it into life; but
simple souls, as they pass Boro-Boedoer in the brief
twilight, mutter incantations, and brown hands grasp
the silver amulets which ward off the powers of evil,
for the deserted temple is still regarded as the haunt
of unknown gods, who may perchance wreak
vengeance on the world which has forsaken them.</p>

<p>The long scroll of ancient history, unrolled by
the sculptured terraces, represents the birth, growth,
and development of Buddhist faith. Queen Maya,
jewelled and flower-crowned, with the miraculous
Babe on her knee, sits among her maidens, the
earth breaking into blossom at the advent of
her star-born child. His education in the mental
and physical achievements imperative on Eastern
royalty, when the sword-pierced heart of the mother
who typified the Virgin Queen of Saints was translated
to Nirvana's rest, is contrasted with the sudden
realisation of life's vanity when brought face to face
with the world's threefold burden of sorrow, sickness
and death. The renunciation of power, wealth and
love follows, liberating the soul for the pilgrimage
along the mystic "path," pursued until "the dew-drop
fell into the shining sea" of Eternity. The
manifold details of the Buddha's traditional career
are vividly pourtrayed on the hoary walls of volcanic
trachyte in outline clear and sharp, as though the
sculptors of the eighth century had just laid down
burin and chisel. The indented leaves of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Bo-Tree, beneath which the Sage meditates, are so
exquisitely carved that they almost seem to flutter
in the breeze. The scene of the deer-park wherein
he judges beasts and men, carefully weighing the
tiniest birds in the balance of the sanctuary,
suggests a prophetic vision of the greater Saviour,
Who declared that even the humble sparrow is
remembered by the Creator. Countless scriptural
truths throw their anticipatory shadows across the
life of the Eastern mystic who approached so closely
to the Christian ideal of a later age, for the Buddha's
spiritual experiences became the inspiration of
unnumbered hearts, and exercised a purifying
influence over every creed of the philosophic East.
The social life of ancient Java, comprising public
ceremonials, domestic occupations, architecture,
agriculture, navigation, drama and music, is
memorialised by succeeding terraces of the igneous
rock which sufficed for the old-world sculptor as the
medium of his Art. An unknown King and Queen,
the traditional founders of Boro-Boedoer, appear in
varied guise, throned and crowned, walking in
religious processions beneath State <i>pajongs</i>,
kneeling before Buddha with open caskets of
treasure, and receiving the homage of the people,
accompanied by bearers of smoking censers and
waving fans. Armed warriors guard the jewelled
thrones, and the popular attitude in every scene of
the royal progress evidences the semi-sacred character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
awarded to Indian sovereignty. The eighth
century <small>A.D.</small> was the meridian of the Javanese
Empire, and in the subsequent changes of
nationality the facial type of the past has altered
beyond recognition, for in the ancient civilisation
depicted on these sculptured terraces, arch&aelig;ologists
assert that every physiognomy is either of Hindu or
Hellenic character. Ships of archaic form, with
banks of rowers; palm-thatched huts built on piles,
in the unchanging fashion of the Malay races;
graceful <i>bedayas</i>, the Nautch girls of Java,
performing the old-world dances still in vogue;
and women with <i>lotahs</i> on their heads, passing in
single file to palm-fringed tanks, might be represented
with equal truth in this twentieth century.
Seedtime and harvest, ploughing and reaping,
bullock-carts and water-buffaloes, fruit-laden wagons
and village <i>passers</i>, pass in turn before the
spectator in this wondrous gallery of native art.
Richly-caparisoned elephants suggest Indian accessories
of royal life and State ceremonial, an
occasional touch of humour enlivening the solemn
pageantry. In one grotesque relief a <i>bedaya</i>
and an elephant stand <i>vis-a-vis</i>, the ponderous
monster imitating the steps of the slim maiden in
floating veil and embroidered robes, her slender
limbs contrasting with the outflung feet of her
clumsy partner. Weird myths of the great fishes
which guided and propelled the coracle-like boats of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>the first Buddhist missionaries to the shores of Java
are perpetuated in stone, and the forest, sloping
down to the wave-beaten coast, shows the rich
vegetation which still clothes this island of eternal
summer. The <i>sumboya</i> or flower of the dead,
droops over stately tombs; bamboo and palm,
banana and bread-fruit, mingle their varied foliage;
mangosteen and pomegranate, mango and tamarind,
acacia and peepul, show themselves as indigenous
growths of the fertile soil; while palace and temple,
carven stairway, and flower-girt pavilion, suggest the
wealth and prosperity of the ancient empire. The
mighty Temple of Boro-Boedoer, built up through
successive ages, indicates the gradual change from
the simplicity of the early faith, at first supplanting,
and eventually becoming incorporated with, the
Brahminism which succeeded it in modified form,
as though rising from the ashes of the earlier Hindu
creed which Buddhism virtually destroyed. In the
higher terrace, the last addition to this stupendous
sanctuary, the images of Buddha represent the ninth
<i>Avatar</i> or Incarnation of the god Vishnu, though
he still sits upon the lotus cushion and holds
the sacred flower in one hand. This inclusion of
Sakya Munyi within the Puranic Pantheon was a
masterly feat of strategy accomplished by reviving
Brahminism, the heresy of the Jains supplying the
link between the rival creeds. All the sculptured
figures, leaning forward in veneration of the mystic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>statue in the central cupola, are invested with the
sacred thread of the Vishnavite Brahmin. The
images of the highest circular terrace are carved in
four symbolical attitudes. The "teaching"
Buddha rests an open palm on one knee; in the
posture of "learning" his hands are outstretched
to receive the gift of knowledge. In "exposition,"
one hand is raised towards Heaven, and in the act
of "demonstration," thumbs and index fingers are
joined. Ferguson points out that within the grey
lattice of each lotus-bell <i>dagoba</i>, the right palm
of the enthroned Buddha curves over the left hand.
This restful posture indicates the state of final
comprehension, when the aspiring soul, raised to the
different spheres of Nirvana by steps of ascending
sanctity, receives increasing peace and satisfaction
from gradual absorption into the Infinite. No creed
passes unaltered through any crucible of national
thought; Indian Buddhism borrowed both form and
colour from races which, in accepting the new faith,
retained their own individuality and modes of
assimilation. They gave as well as received, and
the value of the gift depended on the character of
the giver.</p>

<p>No inscriptions exist on the stones of Boro-Boedoer.
The sculptured reliefs tell their own
story, which admits of diverse interpretations. The
relics of the world-renowned Mystic were dispersed
throughout Asia in the sudden impulse of missionary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>enterprise three centuries after his death, and
every Buddhist temple received some infinitesimal
treasure. No record is found of the date when the
precious relic, probably a hair or an eyelash, was
deposited in the great <i>dagoba</i> of Boro-Boedoer, but
an Indian prince sailed with an imposing fleet to
found a Buddhist empire in Java at the opening of
the 7th century <small>A.D.</small>, and a subsequent inscription
discovered on the coast of Sumatra commemorates
the completion of a seven-storeyed <i>Vihara</i>, evidently
the colossal Temple of Boro-Boedoer, by the contemporary
King of "Greater Java," the ancient name
of Sumatra. In the tenth century, a reigning
monarch sent his sons to India for religious
education. They brought back in their train artists,
sculptors, monks, priests, and the gorgeous paraphernalia
then used in the ceremonial of Buddhist
worship, but the heart of the ancient faith was
atrophied by the indifference of the people, and the
zealous attempt to galvanise a moribund creed into
fresh life failed even to arrest the progress of decay.
National thought, fickle as the wind, had turned
from an impersonal philosophy to the materialistic
cult of Hindu deities, as the Israelites of old
hankered after the visible symbol of Isis and Osiris
in the Golden Calf. No definite creed succeeded in
gaining a permanent hold upon the wandering minds
and shallow feelings of a race whose deepest instincts
reveal the fleeting fancies and inconstant ideas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>indigenous to a sea-faring stock, imbued with the
spirit of change and unrest. A magical charm broods
over the mysterious Temple, the materialised dream
of a mighty past rescued from the sylvan sepulchre
of equatorial vegetation, and restored to a vivid
reality beside which the paintings of Egyptian
tombs sink into comparative insignificance. The
seclusion of the memory-haunted pile enhances the
thrill of an unique experience. Vista after vista
opens into the world of long ago so graphically
depicted on the monumental tablets of the processional
paths, while type and symbol point also to
the infinite future intensely realised by Eastern
mysticism. Mortal life was but a fleeting mirage
besides this vision of the life beyond. For the words
"<i>Shadow</i>, <i>Unreality</i>, <i>Illusion</i>," perpetually repeated
by the yellow-robed monks on the beads of the
Buddhist Rosary were inscribed on the inmost heart
of the faithful disciple, who strove to attain that
detachment from the world of sense inculcated by
the creed expressed on the hoary stones of Boro-Boedoer.</p>

<h3>BRAMBANAM.</h3>


<p>The ruined temples of Brambanam memorialise
that phase of Java's religious history, when the
altars of Buddha were finally deserted, and
Hinduism became the paramount creed of the fickle
populace. An arch&aelig;ological report sent to Sir
Stamford Raffles a century ago, describes the
remains of Brambanam as "stupendous monuments
of the science and taste belonging to a long-forgotten
age, crowded together in the former centre of Hindu
faith." A rough country road leads from the little
white railway station, perched on a desolate plain,
to these far-famed temples. A brown village, shaded
by the dark foliage of colossal kanari-trees, shows
the usual fragility of structure in basket-work walls
and roofs of plaited palm-leaves, but the humble
dwellings, destroyed and rebuilt myriad times on the
ancient site of Java's Hindu capital, have supplemented
native workmanship by a multitude of
carven stones, broken statues, and moss-grown
reliefs, for the ruins, theoretically guarded from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>spoiler's hand, are still inadequately protected, and
the grey <i>recha</i> have been used as seats, landmarks,
or stepping-stones over muddy lane and
brimming water-course. The conversion of Java to
the materialistic creed for which she forsook the
subtleties of an impersonal Buddhism, though
shallow was complete, and the doctrine of impermanence,
inculcated by the discarded faith,
continued an essential factor in spiritual development,
for the inconstancy of the national mind only
found a temporary halting-place in each successive
creed which arrested it. The seed was sown, the
bud opened, and the flower faded, with incredible
rapidity, but the growth while it lasted, showed
phenomenal luxuriance. The erection of these
Hindu sanctuaries signalised the zenith of Javanese
power; their fame travelled across the seas, and
numerous expeditions sailed for this early El Dorado
of the Southern ocean. Kublai Khan came with his
Mongol fleet, but was repulsed with loss, and
branded as a felon. A second and stronger attempt
from the same quarter met with absolute defeat.
Marco Polo, compelled to wait through the rainy
season in Sumatra for a favourable wind, came
hither in the palmy days of medi&aelig;val Portugal, but
returned discomfited. Goths from the Northern
bounds of Thuringian pine forests followed in their
turn, but the power and prestige of Hindu Java
remained invincible until destroyed by the wayward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>fickleness of her own children. Brahminism was
finally discarded for the specious promises of Arabian
invaders, and the lightly-held faith succumbed to
the creed of Islam. Mosques were built, Hindu
temples were forsaken, and Nature's veil of vegetation
was once more suffered to hide altar and statue,
wall and stairway, until every sculptured shrine
became a mere green mound of waving trees,
strangling creepers, and plumy ferns. The memory
of the past was entirely obliterated from the hearts of
the people, and every year buried the relics of the
former religion in a deeper grave.</p>

<p>Siva the Destroyer, and also the Life-Giver, the
Third Person of the Hindu Trinity, together with
Parvati and Brahma, were worshipped here in their
original character, and an exquisite statue of Lora
Jonggran (Parvati in her Javanese guise) remains
enshrined in a richly-decorated chapel, surrounded
by dancing houris, inspired in their sacred measure
by the flute-playing of Krishna. A further instance
of the mode already mentioned by which sentiment
survives dogma in the Malay races, is shown by the
fact that Lora Jonggran still receives the homage
of Javanese women. Flowers are laid at her feet,
love affairs are confided to her advocacy, and as the
shadows deepen across the great quadrangle, a
weeping girl prostrates herself before the smiling
goddess, and, raising brown arms in earnest supplication,
kisses the stone slab at the feet of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>beautiful statue, popularly endowed with some occult
virtue which the loosely-held Mohammedanism of a
later day has failed to discredit or deny. The
temples of Brambanam were erected shortly after the
completion of that upper terrace in the great sanctuary
of Boro-Boedoer which marks the traditional
epoch between Buddhism and the later Hinduism,
including Sakya Munyi among the <i>avatars</i> of
Vishnu. The sacred trees and lions carved here on
the walls of the temple quadrangle, give place in
the galleries to scenes from the great Hindu epic of
the Ramayan. The familiar form of Ganesh, the
elephant-headed God of Wisdom, looms from the
shadows of a vaulted shrine; Nandi, the sacred bull,
stands beneath a carven canopy, and the great
memorial of a bygone faith contains the identical
galaxy of gods found in the Indian temples of the
present day, for the thin veil of Javanese thought
is a transparency rather than a disguise, softening
rather than hiding the clear-cut outlines of the
original idea. The "fatal beauty" of the graceful
waringen-tree has played an ominous part in the
destruction of the Brambanam temples, for the
interlacing roots, like a network of branching veins,
make their devious way through crevice and cranny,
splitting and uplifting the strongest slab, wherein
one tiny crack suffices for the string-like fibres to
gain foothold. Masks and arabesques, fruit and
flowers, fabulous monsters and sacred emblems,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>encrust the grey balustrades and bas-reliefs of the
noble stairways. Roof and column teem with
richest ornament, for Hindu art had reached the
climax of splendour when the great city, formerly
surrounding the monumental group of stately
temples, attained to her utmost power and fame.
The Greek influences which prevailed in Northern
Hindustan were translated to Brambanam in their
attributes of dignity and grace, for the flowing robes
and easy postures of the sculptured figures correct
and modify the grotesque and over-laden character
of original Hindu art. The great stone-paved court
once contained an imposing group of twenty pyramidal
shrines, but only three remain in the original
contour of the so-called "pagoda style," peculiar to
the Dravidian temples of Southern India, from
whence Java derived her special form of faith. The
ruins on the opposite side of the grey quadrangle
are mere cone-shaped piles of rubbish, dust, and
broken stone, but the tapering pyramids, with their
graceful galleries and processional terraces, richly
carved and adorned with images, enable us to
reconstruct in imagination the stately beauty of the
architectural panorama once displayed by the temple
courts. Scenes from the Ramayan and Mahabharata
adorn the great blocks of the boundary wall,
sculptured in high relief. The Vedic Powers of
Nature, with Indra as the god of storm and
hurricane, manifest the recognition of that earlier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>belief which became submerged in the vast system
of Pantheistic mythology. The faith of further India
takes form and colour from the idiosyncracy of Java,
and the goddess Parvati, or Kali, worshipped under
these different names according to her attributes of
glory or terror, becomes Lora Jonggran, the benignant
goddess of Java, popularly known as "the
maiden of the beauteous form." Four lofty stairways
ascend to the hoary chapels within each
sculptured pyramid, every dusky vault containing
the broken image of the tutelary <i>Deva</i>.</p>

<p>Only separated from Brambanam by a winding
path and a green belt of jungle, stands the great
Buddhist temple of Chandi Sewon, and the colossal
figures flanking the entrance gate indicate a decadent
phase of the ancient creed which Boro-Boedoer
illustrates in the purity of earlier developement.
Chandi Sewon, the "thousand temples," includes
in the number myriad unimportant shrines, ruined,
overthrown, or covered with a green network of
interlacing creepers. The great architectural pile,
built at a uniform level, surrounds the central
sanctuary with five great enclosures. All the
ancient faiths of the world contain foreshadowings
or reflections of Christian truth, and the cruciform
temple which forms the climax of this monumental
erection shows the mystic value attached to the
sacred Sign so frequently encountered in Buddhist
shrines, and known as the <i>Shvastika</i>. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>numerous chapels of Chandi Sewon contained the
galaxy of Tirthankas or Buddhist saints which the
materialism of the Jains added to the impersonal
subtleties of esoteric Buddhism. The blank emptiness
and desertion of this vast sanctuary produces
an impression of unutterable desolation. The weed-grown
courts, the ruined altars, and the moss-blackened
arches, encumbered with indistinguishable
heaps of shattered sculpture, lack all the reposeful
charm of Boro-Boedoer, still a sermon in stone which
he who runs may read. The degenerate creed
memorialised by Chandi Sewon, has failed to impress
itself on the colossal pile which bears melancholy
witness to the evanescent character of the heretical
offshoot from the parent stem. Jungle and palm-forest
in Central Java contain innumerable vestiges
of pyramidal temples, palaces, and shrines; vaults
hidden beneath the shrouding trees have yielded a
rich store of gold, silver, and bronze ornaments,
household utensils, and armour. For many years
the peasants of the region between Samarang and
Boro-Boedoer paid their taxes in gold melted from
the treasure trove turned up by the plough, or dug
from the precincts of some forgotten sanctuary,
buried beneath the rank vegetation of the teaming
soil. The discarded Hindu gods still haunt the
forest depths, and the superstitious native, as he
threads the dark recesses of the solemn woods, gazes
with apprehensive eyes on the trident of Siva, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>the elephant's trunk of Ganesh emerging from the
trailing wreaths and matted tapestry of liana and
creeper, veiling the blackened stone of each decaying
shrine. Nature has proved stronger than Art or
Creed, in the eternal growth beneath an equatorial
sun, of the kingdom over which she reigns in
immortal life. Silently and insidiously she undermines
man's handiwork, and realisation of his futile
conflict with her invincible power enters with
disastrous effect into the popular mind, lacking that
immutable force without which the spiritual temple
of faith rests on a foundation of shifting sand.
Kawi literature, popularised by translation, and
familiar through the medium of national drama,
interprets Javanese creeds and traditions. This
"utterance of poetry" derived from Sanskrit, fell
into disuse after the Mohammedan conquest, though
a few Arabic words became incorporated into the two-fold
language comprising <i>Krama</i>, the ceremonial
speech, and <i>Ngoko</i>, the speech of "thee and
thou," or colloquial form of address. The island of
Bali, and the slopes of the Tengger range, retain a
modification of Hinduism, and Bali treasures a Kawi
version of the Ramayan and Mahabharata epics.
Many inspiring thoughts and noble sentiments,
expressed in story and song, have become well-known
maxims identified with Javanese life. "Rob
no man of due credit, for the sun, by depriving the
moon of her light, adds no lustre to his own."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
"As the lotus floats in water, the heart rests in a
pure body." "Ye cannot take riches to the grave,
but he who succoureth the poor in this world shall
find a better wealth hereafter." A <i>babad</i> or
rhythmical ballad of semi-religious character belongs
to every province, but though many details of temple
worship&mdash;Buddhist, Hindu, and Mohammedan&mdash;may
be gathered from the lengthy scroll, heroic and
princely exploits, myths and traditions, encumber
the sacred text, which Eastern imagination transforms
into a fairy tale. Creeds lose their chiselled
outline, and crumble away in the disintegrating
medium of Javanese thought, which blends them
into each other with changing colour and borrowed
light. The inconstant soul of the Malay knows
nothing of that rigid adherence to some centralising
truth which often forms the heart of a living faith,
and his religious history is an age-long record of
failure, change, desertion, and oblivion, repeated in
varying cadences, and inscribed in unmistakeable
characters on the ruined sanctuaries of old Mataram.</p>

<h3>SOURAKARTA.</h3>


<p>The imperial city of Sourakarta, commonly
abbreviated into "Solo," was the hereditary capital
of the Mohammedan emperors, now mere puppet-princes
held in the iron grasp of Holland. The
present Susunhan, descended from both Hindu and
Arab ancestry, maintains a brilliant simulacrum of
royal state, and his huge Kraton, far surpassing that
of Djokjacarta, contains 10,000 inhabitants. The
pronounced Hindu type, though debased and
degraded, remains noticeable even amid the all-pervading
environment of squalor and disorder,
which dims the gorgeous colour and brilliant
ceremonial, producing the effect of jewels flung in
the dust. A dense throng of brown humanity, clad
and unclad, walks to and fro beneath the dusky
avenues of feathery tamarinds which shield Solo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>from the ardour of the tropical sun. Old crones,
with unkempt locks streaming over brown and bony
necks, pass by, their wide mouths distorted and
discoloured with sucking the scarlet lumps of
<i>Sarya</i>, from which the native derives unfailing
consolation, even the Javanese girl showing absolute
disregard of the disfigurement produced by this
favourite stimulant. Deep moats, lichen-stained
walls, and hoary forts, invest Solo with a feudal
aspect, and the grim tower of Vostenberg menaces
the Kraton with bristling cannon, reminding the
hereditary Ruler of his subserviency to modern
Holland, for only a melancholy illusion of past glory
remains to him. The dragon-carved eaves of
the Chinese quarter, the open <i>tokos</i> beneath
waringen boughs, the shadowy <i>passer</i> brightened
by mounds of richly-coloured fruits, and the stuccoed
palaces of Court dignitaries, framed in dark foliage,
give character and interest to the city, where the life
of the past lingers in a series of street pictures
remaining from bygone days of pomp and show.
Ministers of State walk beneath many-coloured
official umbrellas, held by obsequious attendants;
graceful <i>bedayas</i>, in glittering robes, execute
intricate dances, and <i>gamelon</i> players discourse
weird music on pipe and drum. Court ballet-girls,
known as <i>Serimpi</i>, are borne swiftly through the
crowd in gilded litters, and masked actors give
<i>al fresco</i> performances of the historic <i>Wayang-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>wayang</i>,
represented by living persons, for the actual
"shadow-play" is impossible in broad daylight.
The colour of the mask indicates the character
assumed by the actor. The golden mask signifies
Divinity, heroes wear white, and evil spirits black or
red. Here, as elsewhere, the profile of the grotesque
disguise invariably shows either the Greek, or the
hawk-nose strangely suggestive of Egyptian origin,
and which, as a variation on human physiognomy,
specially commended itself to Mohammedan thought
as a skilful evasion of an inconvenient dogma.
Elsewhere the spirit of concession to alien ideas is
almost unknown, even flower and leaf being conventionalised
on those architectural monuments of Islam
which form the supreme expression of Mussulman
genius. The suppression of national amusements
has ever proved a perilous step, and in the heart of
this ancient kingdom the original setting of Javanese
life remained in stereotyped form. The moving
panorama of the tree-shadowed streets possesses a
strange fascination, and the light of the past lingers
like a sunset glow over the human element of the
changed and modernised city. The twang of double-stringed
lutes, the tinkle of metal tubes, and the
elusive melody of silvery gongs, echo from the ages
whence dance and song descend as an unchanged
inheritance. An itinerant minstrel recites the
history of <i>Johar Mankain</i>, the Una of Java, who
shone like a jewel in the world which could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>tarnish the purity and devotion of one whose heart
entertained no evil thought. In the intricate byways
of the crumbling Kraton, a professional story-teller
draws a squalid crowd of women from their dark
hovels and cellars, with the magic wand of enchantment
wielded by the reciter of heroic deeds from the
<i>Panji</i>, exaggerated out of all recognition by the
addition of fairies and giants, demons and dwarfs, to
the simple human element of the original story.
The apathy and decay of native life, lacking all the
scope and interest common to a strenuous age,
appears galvanised into some fleeting semblance of
vitality by the extravaganza presented to it, for the
language of hyperbole is the natural expression of
Eastern thought, and penetrates into mental recesses
unknown and unexplored by the relater of unvarnished
facts. The quick response of the native mind
to Nature's teaching, and the wealth of tradition
woven round flower and tree, mountain and stream,
foster the love of marvel and miracle in those whose
daily wants are supplied by the prodigality of a
tropical climate, for the innate poetry of the race has
never been crushed out by the weight of practical
necessities.</p>

<p>A permit being obtained to view the interior
of the Susunhan's palace under a Dutch escort,
we present ourselves at the colonnaded portico,
where the Prince Probolingo, brother of the
Susunhan, receives his visitors with simple courtesy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>This descendant of a hundred kings is simply attired
in a dark brown <i>sarong</i> and turban, the <i>kris</i> in his
belt of embroidered velvet ablaze with a huge boss
of diamonds. Attendants, holding State umbrellas
over the favoured guests, usher them through
marble-paved courts, in one of which a little prince
is seated, with furled golden umbrella behind him
to denote his rank, a group of royal children playing
round him, their lithe brown forms half-hidden in
the green shadows of a great tamarind tree. A
superb marble ball-room with crystal chandeliers,
forms an incongruous modern feature of the spacious
Palace, but helps to popularise the so-called "Nail of
the Universe" among the European inhabitants of
Solo, by the splendid entertainments continually
given at the imperial command. The porcelain and
glass rooms convey an idea of the boundless
hospitality bestowed; the thousands of wine-glasses
being especially noticeable, for 800 guests are often
invited at a time. Treasures of linen and costly
embroidery, silken hangings and velvet banners,
gorgeous carpets and mats of finest texture, are
displayed to our admiring eyes, but possession rather
than enjoyment is the keynote of Eastern character,
and the bales and bundles of priceless value, kept in
huge cabinets of fragrant cedar-wood, seldom see
the light of day. Long counting-houses are crowded
with native scribes, their brown bodies naked except
for <i>sarong</i> and <i>kris</i>, the perpetual rattle of the abacus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>making a deafening din, for apparently the smallest
sum cannot be added up under Eastern skies without
the assistance of this wire frame with the ever-shifting
marbles. Cramped fingers move wearily
over the yellow parchments, with their long lists of
undecipherable hieroglyphics, and the turbaned
heads are scarcely raised until the entrance of the
Prince necessitates the time-honoured salute of
the <i>dodok</i>, the crouching posture assumed in the
presence of a superior. The needs and luxuries of
the immense royal household render the counting-house
a feature of the utmost importance. The
Prince Probolingo has himself forty wives, and a
Harem in proportion to their numbers, the
Susunhan's Imperial Harem far exceeding that of
his brother. Wonderful tales are told of the fairy-like
loveliness belonging to these inner palaces, with
their treasures of ivory and sandalwood, cedar and
ebony, but they are jealously guarded from intrusion,
and a glimpse of their fantastic glory seldom
permitted to Western eyes. After an exhibition of
gold-encrusted litters and painted coaches of State,
used in royal processions, the Prince, a clever-looking
man of forty, takes wine with his guests.
Each stand of solid silver contains six bottles, the
crouching attendants also carrying silver trays of
tumblers and wine-glasses, a gaily clad servitor with
a huge silver ice-bowl bringing up the rear. After
drinking the health of His Royal Highness in iced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Rhine wine, we make our adieux, and escape from
our splendid <i>pajongs</i> of rainbow hue on the
steps of the Great Entrance, conveying our thanks
through the medium of an interpreter. These
fain&eacute;ant princes learn no tongue but their own,
greatly to the advantage of their Dutch masters.
The colossal incomes assigned to scions of the royal
stock only serve the double purpose of political
expediency and personal extravagance, for the
luxury of a licentious Court remains unchecked, and
the idea of educating or reforming tributary princes
is unknown in Java. Territorial rights were relinquished
for pecuniary gains, and the entire Court of
the Susunhan is in the pay of the Dutch, the wealth
amassed from the richest island in the world
affording ample compensation for the pensions
lavishly bestowed on the former owners of the
tropical Paradise. The Dutch Resident, in his
capacity of "Elder Brother" to the indigenous race,
claims the full privileges of his assumed position,
but the advancing tide of social reform has even
touched these distant shores, and the alien authority
tends on the whole to the welfare of the community.
Hygienic regulations are compulsory, and even here
the traditions of Holland enjoin an amount of
whitewashing and cleaning up unique in tropical
colonies. The green and vermilion panelled <i>sarongs</i>
of Solo are renowned for their elaborate designs, and
the painting of <i>battek</i>, or cotton cloth, remains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>a flourishing industry of the ancient capital. The
intricate beauty of the hand-made patterns far
surpasses that of the woven fabrics wherewith new
mills and factories begin to supply the market.
Centuries of hereditary training, from the days when
royal Solo was a self-supporting city, contribute to
the amazing skill of the <i>battek</i> girls, but the
elaboration of native Art is doomed to decay, for
Time, hitherto a negligeable quantity in this
"summer isle of Eden," begins to reveal a value
unknown to the Javanese past, and as the poetry of
illumination vanished before the prose of the printing
press, so the painting of <i>battek</i> must inevitably give
way to the wholesale methods of Manchester in the
near future of Java, just awakening from her spellbound
sleep to the changed conditions of life and
labour. An exquisite plain, described by de Charnay
as unrivalled even in Java, surrounds Sourakarta
with belts of palm, avenues of waringen, and
picturesque rice-fields of flaming green and vivid
gold. Azure peaks frame the enchanting picture.
The storied heights are rich in traditions of gods and
heroes, with innumerable myths haunting the ruined
temples which cluster round the base of the
mountain range, and suggest themselves as relics of
an earlier creed than Buddhism or Brahminism.
Archaic sculptures, obelisks, and gateways, massive
and undecorated, recall the architecture of Egyptian
sanctuaries, but no record exists which throws any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>light on the origin of the extensive monuments of a
forgotten past, though the triple pyramid of Mount
Lawu is still a place of sacrifice to Siva the
Destroyer. Pilgrims climb the steep ascent to lay
their marigold garlands and burn their incense-sticks
at the foot of the rude cairn erected in
propitiation of the Divine wrath, typified by the cloud
and tempest hovering round the jagged pinnacles of
the volcanic range, which frowns with perpetual
menace above the verdant loveliness of plain and
woodland. The instinctive worship seems one of
those hereditary relics of a perished faith so
frequently encountered in Java; a blind impulse for
which no reason can be ascribed by the devotee,
swayed by those mysterious forces of the subconscious
self which seem imperishable elements in
the brown races of the Malay Archipelago. The
native Court attracts myriad parasites, and the
wealthy Chinese half-castes, or <i>Paranaks</i> of Solo,
with their inborn commercial genius, surpass all
competitors in the pursuit of fortune. The three
centuries of mixed marriages have modified Chinese
conservatism, and though the <i>Paranak</i> is severely
taxed, and excluded from all political offices, he
remains supreme in the kingdom of finance, regarded
even by the Dutch as an indispensable factor in the
complicated affairs of the island.</p>

<p>The great <i>passer</i> of Solo becomes an endless
delight, and the interminable corridors, where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>fumes of incense mingle with the breath of flowers,
convey strange suggestions of antiquity. Simple
meals of rice and bananas progress round cooking-pots
of burnished copper. Pink pomelo and purple
mangosteen vary the repast; strips of green banana
leaf folded into cups fastened with an acanthus
thorn, or serving as plates for Dame Nature's
prodigality, provide the accessories of the feast as
well as the provisions. The Javanese populace,
wonderfully free from those household cares which
involve so much time and trouble in Northern
nations strenuously occupied in keeping the wolf
from the door, and left to carry out their own
inventions, have evolved numerous methods of
blending the different metals&mdash;steel and iron, brass
and silver. The veinings of the <i>kris</i>, beautiful as
those of any Toledo blade, are produced by the
welding of metals steeped in lime-juice and arsenic,
which destroy the iron and retain the ingrained
pattern. The chains of mingled brass and silver
show exquisite designs and a special charm of colour,
in the soft golden hue and subdued gleam of the
heavy links, with their richly-enamelled talismans
of ruby and turquoise enamel. Soft voices, tranquil
movements, and courteous manners are the age-long
heritage of Malay idiosyncracy, and even in the
crowded <i>passer</i>, with its horde of buyers and
sellers, noise and dispute are non-existent. It is a
market of dreamland, and though echoes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>marching feet and music of native bands remind us
that we are in imperial Sourakarta, the busy hive
of the <i>passer</i> suggests a panoramic picture of
native life, rather than the pushing, jostling crowd
represented by the ordinary idea of a market in that
Western hemisphere which, in bestowing so many
priceless gifts on humanity, has taken from it the
old-world grace of repose.</p>

<h3>SOURABAYA AND THE TENGGER.</h3>


<p>The port of Sourabaya, supreme in mercantile
importance, ranks as the second city of Java, as it
contains the military headquarters, the principal
dockyards, and the arsenal. Leagues of rice and
sugar-cane lie between Solo and Sourabaya, the landscape
varied by gloomy teak woods, feathery
tamarinds, and stately mango trees. White towns
nestle in rich vegetation, and the green common
known as the <i>aloon-aloon</i> marks each hybrid suburb,
Europeanized by Dutch canals, white bridges,
and red-tiled houses, planted amid a riotous wealth
of palm and banana. A broad river, brimming over
from the deluge of the previous night, flows through
burning Sourabaya; a canal, gay with painted
<i>praus</i> connecting it with the vast harbour,
where shipping of all nations lies at anchor, the
sheltered roads bristling with a forest of masts
and funnels. Bungalows, in gorgeous gardens, flank
dusky avenues of colossal trees, for even Sourabaya,
the hottest place in steaming Java, enjoys "a
boundless contiguity of shade." In the <i>sawa</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>fields broad-eaved huts, set on stilts above the
swamp, protect the brown boys who frighten birds
from the rice, for the clapping and shouting must be
carried on under shelter from the ardent sun. No
air blows from the rippling water, set with acres of
lotus-beds, the fringed chalices of rose and azure
swaying on their plate-like leaves of palest green.
The heterogeneous character of Sourabaya gives
unwonted interest to the streets, uniquely brilliant
in grouping and colour. Gilded eaves of Chinese
houses, many-tiered Arab mosques, encrusted with
polished tiles of blue and purple, white colonnades
of Dutch bungalows, and pointed huts of woven
basket-work within wicker gate and bamboo fence,
mingle in fantastic confusion to frame a series of
living pictures. Cream-coloured bullocks and
spirited Timor ponies, in creaking waggons and
ramshackle carriages, pass in endless procession.
Bronze-hued coolies balance heavy loads on the
swaying <i>pikolan</i>, a sloping pole of elastic bamboo,
and strolling players, rouged and tinselled, collect
crowds in every open space where a fluttering
tamarind-tree offers a welcome patch of shadow to
each turbaned audience, clad in the paradisaical garb
of the tropics. Graceful Malay women flit silently
past, in pleasing contrast to their burly Dutch
mistresses, clad in a caricature of native garb which
the appalling heat of Sourabaya renders a more
slatternly disguise than even colonial <i>sans g&eacute;ne</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>accomplishes elsewhere. Orchids spread broad
spathes of scented bloom from grey trunks of courtyard
trees, and cascades of crimson and purple
creepers tumble over arch and wall. Insinuating
Chinamen untie bundles of <i>sarongs</i>, scarves, and
delicate embroideries on the marble steps of hotel
porticoes, where the prolonged "shopping" of the
drowsy East is catered for by the industrious
Celestial, when <i>tokos</i> are closed, and the tradesman
sleeps on the floor amid his piled-up wares, for
the slumber of Java is too deep to be lightly
disturbed, and the solemnity of the long siesta seems
regarded almost as a religious function. In this
far-off land of dreams it seems "always afternoon,"
and the complacency wherewith the entire population
places itself "hors de combat" becomes a perpetual
irritation to the traveller, anxious to seize a golden
opportunity of fresh experience. The sun sinks out
of sight before the sultry atmosphere begins to cool.
The weird "gecko," a large lizard which foretells
rain, screams "Becky! Becky!" in the garden
shadows, and a cry of "Toko! Toko!" echoes from
another unseen speaker of a mysterious language,
while wraith-like forms of his tiny brethren make
moving patterns on the white columns, as the
hungry little reptiles hunt ceaselessly for the
mosquitos which form their staple diet. Lashing
rain and deafening thunder at length cool the fiery
furnace, blue lightning flares on the solid blackness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>of heaven, and the storm only dies away when we
start at dawn for Tosari, the mountain sanatorium
of the Tengger. The flat and flooded land glows
with the vivid green of springing rice, tremulous
tamarind and blossoming teak bordering a road gay
with pilgrim crowds, for the great volcano of the
Tengger remains one of Nature's mystic altars,
dedicated to prayer and sacrifice. Moslem girls in
yellow veils jostle brown men with white prayer-marks
and clanking bangles. The <i>sari</i> of India
replaces the <i>sarong</i> of Java, with fluttering folds of
red and purple; children, clad only in silver chains
and medals, or strings of blue beads, dart through the
crowd, from whence the familiar types of Malay and
Javanese personality are absent. We change carts
in a busy roadside <i>passer</i>, which drives a roaring
trade in rice-cakes and fruit, syrups and stews, to
mount through changing zones of vegetation, where
palms give place to tree ferns, and luscious frangipanni
or gardenia yields to rose and chrysanthemum.
From the half-way house of Poespo, a forest road
ascends to Tosari. Sombre casuarina, most mournful
of the pine tribe, mingles with teak and
mahogany in dense woods falling away on either
side from the shadowy path. Innumerable monkeys
swing from bough to bough, eating wild fruits, and
breaking off twigs to pelt the intruders on their
domains. At length the sylvan scenery gives place
to endless fields of cabbage, potatoes, maize, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>onions, for the cool heights of the Tengger range
serve the prosaic purpose of market-garden to
Eastern Java, and all European vegetables may be
cultivated here with success. A patchwork counterpane
of green, brown, and yellow, clothes these steep
slopes, but the extent of the mountain chain, and
the phantasmal outlines of volcanic peaks, absorb
the incongruities grafted upon them. Valerian and
violet border the track between swarthy pines
with grey mosses hanging down like silver beards
from forked branches, and sudden mists shroud the
landscape in vaporous folds, torn to shreds by
gusts of wind, to melt away into the blue sky,
suddenly unveiled in dazzling glimpses between the
surging clouds. A long flight of mossy steps ascends
to the plateau occupied by the Sanatorium, with
wide verandahs and a poetic garden, like some old
Italian pleasaunce, with fountain and sundial, espaliered
orange boughs, and ancient rose-trees overhanging
paved walks, gay parterres, and avenues of
myrtle or heliotrope. Flowers are perennial even
on these airy heights, and dense hedges of datura,
with long white bells drooping in myriads over the
pointed foliage, transform each narrow lane into a
vista of enchantment. Eastern Java spreads map-like
beneath the overhanging precipice, the blue
strait of Madoera curving between fretted peak and
palm-clad isle. The velvety plum-colour of nearer
ranges fades through tints of violet and mauve into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>the ethereal lilac of distant summits. The lowlands
gleam with brimming fish-ponds and flooded
<i>sawas</i>, as though the sea penetrated through
creek and inlet to the heart of the green country,
the vague glitter of this watery world investing the
scene with dream-like unreality. Brown <i>campongs</i>
cling to mountain crest and precipitous ledge.
These almost inaccessible fastnesses were colonised
after the Moslem conquest by a Hindu tribe which
refused to relinquish Brahminism. Driven from
place to place by the fanatical hordes of Islam on
the downfall of the Hindu empire, the persecuted
race, a notable exception to native inconstancy and
indifference, retreated by degrees to this mountain
stronghold, where they successfully retained their
religious independence, and defended themselves
from Mohammedan hostility. Brahminism through
centuries of isolation, has assimilated many
extraneous heathen rites, and wild superstitions have
overlaid the original creed. The worship of the
Tenggerese is now mainly directed to the ever-active
crater of the awe-inspiring Bromo, always faced by
the longer side of the windowless communal houses,
built to contain the several generations of the
families which in patriarchal fashion inhabit these
spacious dwellings. Huge clouds of smoke from the
majestic volcano curl perpetually above the surrounding
peaks, and float slowly westward, the thunderous
roar of the colossal crater echoing in eternal menace
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>through the rarefied air, and regarded as the voice of
the god who inhabits the fiery Inferno. These lonely
hills, ravaged by tempest and haunted by beasts of
prey, are the hiding-places of fear and the cradles of
ever-deepening superstition. Wild fancies sway the
untaught mountaineers, responsive to Nature's
wonders, though powerless to interpret their signification.
The constant struggle for existence
produces a character utterly opposed to that of the
suave and facile Malay. The graces of life are
unknown, but the strenuous temperament of the
Tenggerese is shown by indefatigable industry in the
difficult agriculture of the mountain region, and the
careful cultivation of the vegetables for which the
district is renowned. Day by day, the Tenggerese
women&mdash;gaunt, scantily-clad, and almost unsexed
by incessant toil in the teeth of wind and weather&mdash;carry
down their burdens to the plain, their backs
bent under the weight of the huge crates, while the
brown and wizened children are prematurely aged
and deformed by their share in the family toil.
The more prosperous inhabitant carries his vegetables
on a mountain pony, trained to wonderful
feats in the art of sliding up and climbing down walls
of rock almost devoid of foothold, for the riding of
Tenggerese youth and maiden rivals that of the
Sioux Indian. Misdirected zeal strips the hills of
forest growth; the scanty pines of the higher zone
serving as fuel, and the ruthless destruction of timber
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>brings the dire result of decreasing rainfall. Only
bamboo remains wherewith to build the communal
houses, formerly constructed of tastefully blended
woods, and the flimsy substitute, unfitted to resist
drenching rain and raging wind, is dragged with the
utmost difficulty from cleft and gorge along rude
tracks hewn out in the mountain side. Rice, elsewhere
the mainstay of life in Java, has never been
cultivated by the Tenggerese, the sowing and
planting of the precious crop being forbidden to them
during the era of gradual retreat before the
Mohammedan army centuries ago, and the innate
conservatism of the secluded tribe, in spite of life's
altered environment, clings to the dead letter of an
obsolete law. The tigers, once numerous round
Tosari, have retreated into the jungle clothing the
lower hills, and seldom issue from their forest lairs
unless stress of weather drives them upward for a
nightly prowl round byre and pen. The destruction
of covert renders Tosari immune from this past peril,
and the tragic tiger stories related round the hearthstone
of the communal house are becoming oral
traditions of a forgotten day, gathering round themselves
the moss and lichen of fable and myth.</p>

<p>The main interest of Tosari centres round the
stupendous Bromo, possessing the largest crater in
the world, a fathomless cavity three miles in
diameter, veiled in Stygian darkness, and suggesting
the yawning mouth of hell. This bottomless pit,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>bubbling like a boiling cauldron, pouring out black
volumes of sulphureous smoke, and clamouring with
unceasing thunder, was for ages a blood-stained altar
of human sacrifice. Every year the fairest maiden
of the Tengger was the chosen victim offered to Siva,
who, in his attribute of a Consuming Fire, occupied
the volcanic abyss. The worship of the Divine
Destroyer has ever been a fruitful source of crime
and cruelty, and a tangible atmosphere of evil lingers
round those hoary temples of India dedicated to the
Avenging Deity, whose fanatical followers are
reckoned by millions. Through the inversion of
creed peculiar to Hindu Pantheism, the propitiation
of Divine wrath has become the fundamental principle
of religion, and pathetic appeals for mercy
continually ascend from darkened hearts to those
unseen powers vividly present to Hindu thought,
which, amid countless errors and degradations, has
never ceased to grasp the central fact of Eternity.
The impalpable air teems with Divinity. Watchful
eyes and clutching hands surround the pilgrim's
path, and unseen spirits dog faltering footsteps as
they stumble through the snares and pitfalls of
earthly life. In the rude tribes of the Tengger,
hereditary faith reflects the uncompromising features
of local environment. The lotus-eating races of the
tropical lowlands, with their feeble grasp on the
sterner aspects of creed and character, have nothing
in common with this Indian tribe, remaining on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>outskirts of an alien civilisation. The creed for
which the early Tenggerese fought and conquered,
has cooled from white heat to a shapeless petrifaction,
and weird influences throng the ruined temple
of a moribund faith, but the shadows which loom
darkly above the mouldering altars still command the
old allegiance, and a thousand hereditary ties bind
heart and soul to the past.</p>

<p>The expedition to the Bromo, by horse or litter,
affords the supreme experience of Javanese volcanoes.
The broken track, knee-deep in mud and
rent by landslips, traverses fields of Indian corn,
rocky clefts, and rugged water-courses. The familiar
flora of Northern Europe fringes babbling brooks,
their banks enamelled with wild strawberries and
reddening brambles. Curtains of ghostly mist lift
at intervals to disclose the magical pink and blue of
the mountain distance, as sunrise throws a shaft of
scarlet over the grim cliff's of the Moengal Pass. A
chasm in the stony wall reveals the famous Sand
Sea below the abrupt precipice, a yellow expanse of
arid desert encircling three fantastic volcanoes. The
pyramidal Batok, the cloud-capped Bromo, and the
serrated Widodaren, set in the wild solitude of this
desolate Sahara, form a startling picture, suggesting
a sudden revelation of Nature's mysterious laboratories.
The deep roar of subterranean thunder, and
the fleecy clouds of sulphureous smoke ever rising
from the vast furnaces of the Bromo, emphasise the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>solemnity of the marvellous scene. Native ideas
recognise this terror-haunted landscape as the point
where Times touches Eternity, and natural forces
blend with occult influences. Tjewara Lawang,
"the gate of the spirits," traditionally haunted by
the countless <i>Devas</i> of Hindu Pantheism, bounds
the ribbed and tumbled Sand Sea with a black
bridge of fretted crags, from whence the invisible
host keeps watch and ward over the regions of
eternal fire.</p>

<p>By a fortunate coincidence, the annual festival
of the Bromo is celebrated to-day, when Siva, the
Third Person of the Hindu Triad, is propitiated by a
living sacrifice. Goats and buffaloes were flung
into the flaming crater long after the offering of
human victims was discontinued, but, alas for the
chicanery of a degenerate age! even the terrified
animals thrown into the air by the sacrificing priest
never reach the mystic under-world, their downward
progress being arrested by a skilled accomplice, who
catches them at a lower level, and risks great Siva's
wrath by preserving them for more prosaic uses.
The silence of the Sand Sea is broken to-day by the
bustle of a gay market on the brink of the yellow
plain. The terrific descent through a gash in the
precipice, carved by falling boulders, landslips, and
torrential rains, lands the battered pilgrim in the
midst of a lively throng in festal array. Girls in
rose and orange <i>saris</i>, with silver pins in sleek dark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>hair plaited with skeins of scarlet wool, dismount
from rough ponies for refreshment, or gallop across
the Sand Sea to the mountain of sacrifice. The
turbaned men in rough garb of indigo and brown
show less zeal than their womenkind, and betel-chewing,
smoking, or the consumption of syrups
and sweetmeats, prove more attractive than the
religious service, for modern materialism extends
even to these remote shores, and the Avenging God
is often worshipped by proxy.</p>

<p>The Sand Sea was originally the base of the
Tengger volcano, split from head to foot by an
appalling eruption, which forced mud, sand, and lava
from the enclosing walls into the surrounding valley.
Fresh craters formed in the vast depths of sand and
molten metal; the three new volcanoes&mdash;Bromo,
Battok, and Widodaren&mdash;casting themselves up
from the blazing crucibles hidden beneath the fire-charged
earth. We stand on the thin and
crumbling crust of the globe's most friable surface,
a mere veil concealing fountains of eternal fire,
foaming solfataras, and smoking fumaroles. Circle
after circle, the great belt of volcanic peaks rises
around us, visible outlets of incalculable forces, ever
menacing the world with ruin and havoc.</p>

<p>On the steep descent, a few devout pilgrims offer
preliminary sacrifices of food, or flowers, to the
<i>Devas</i> of the mountains, laying the little treasures
in oval vaults dug by human hands, before entering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>the inner courts of the fiery sanctuary. The yellow
Sand Sea, swept by a moaning wind, sends up
whirling eddies, and the dusky haze shimmers in
fantastic outlines, which probably originated the
idea of spiritual presences hovering round the
scene. Grey heather and clumps of cypress-grass
dot the wild Sahara with their dry and colourless
monotony, but give place on the southern side to
patches of fern and turf, the scanty pasture of the
mountain ponies, herding together until sickness or
accident breaks the ranks, when the hapless
sufferer, deserted by his kind, falls an easy prey to
the wild dogs of the Tengger ranges. A heap of
bleaching bones points to some past tragedy, and
terrifies the swerving horses of the native pilgrims.
The ascent of the Bromo is negotiated from the
eastern side to the lip of the gigantic crater.
Slanting precipices of lava, their grey flanks scored
with black gullies below the volcanic ash which
covers the upper slopes, rise to the jagged pinnacles
bordering the black gulf of eternal mystery and
night. A rickety ladder of bamboo, approached
through a chaos of boulders, mounts to the edge of
the profound abyss. The ladder has been renewed
for this Day of Atonement, and worshippers clad in
rainbow hues crowd round the base of the volcano,
while the priests of Siva, in motley robes of brilliant
patchwork, adorned with cabalistic tracery in white,
ascend the swaying rungs, bearing their struggling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>victims, bleating, crowing, and clucking in mortal
terror. Stalwart arms toss the black goat with
accurate aim to an assistant priest, who passes on
his clever "catch" to a third expert in the task
of hoodwinking Siva and depriving him of his lawful
prey. Sundry cocks and hens, evidently toothsome
morsels, are then thrown from one priest to another,
and saved for the cooking-pot, but a tough-looking
chanticleer of the Cochin China persuasion is finally
selected, and cast into the seething pit to propitiate
the terrible wrath of the Avenging Deity at the
smallest expense and loss to the astute priesthood.
At the close of the sacerdotal is sacreligious performance,
we mount the shaking ladder to a thatched
shed on the rim of the crater. From hence,
between the dense volumes of smoke, the huge
cavity is visible to a depth of 600 feet. Sallow
clouds of sulphur emerge from a pandemonium of
tumultuous clamour; red-hot stones shoot upward,
but fall back into the chasm before they reach us;
burning ashes strike the smooth walls with a weird
scream, and then whirl back into the darkness;
yellow solfataras rise in foaming jets, with the fierce
hiss of unseen serpents, and bellowing thunders
shake the earth. The superb spectacle of nature's
power in her armoury of terror is unique among the
volcanos of Java, for unless the Bromo blazes in the
throes of a violent eruption, when the ascent to the
crater becomes impossible, no danger exists in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>gazing down into the mysterious abyss. At every
gust which rages round this laboratory of Nature,
the vast clouds&mdash;black, yellow, and blue&mdash;floating
away into space, assume grotesque forms suggesting
primeval monsters or menacing giants, darkening
the skies with their ghostly presence. Driving rain
and a rising gale hasten a rapid descent to the Sand
Sea, but the sudden storm dies away into sunlit
mists. The climb to the Moenggal Pass is complicated
by a series of pools and cascades; the horses
pick their own perilous way, but the management
of the chairs by the noisy coolies demands superhuman
strength and security of hand and foot,
the crazy and battered <i>doolie</i> escaping falls and
collisions by a continuous miracle.</p>

<p>The expedition to Ngandwona, in the heart of
the hills, skirts green precipices and traverses
brown <i>campongs</i> forlorn and neglected, like this
stranded Hindu race, incapable of adjustment to
life's law of change, and retaining the form without
the spirit of the past. The glens lie veiled in cloud,
but the peaks bask in sunshine. Waterfalls dash
through thickets of crimson foxglove, and daturas
swing their fragrant bells over the dancing water.
A little goatherd, leading his bleating flock, plays
on a reed flute to summon a straggler from a distant
crag. The brown figure, in linen waistcloth and
yellow turban, suggests that Indian personality
which has survived ages of exile on these lonely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>heights. The route to Ngandwona discloses the
Tengger in a different aspect; the volcanos are far
away, and this central region is rich in pastoral
pictures full of lulling charm. The voice of the
Bromo still breaks the silence of the deep valley
with a mysterious undertone, but only benignant
<i>Devas</i> haunt this flower-filled hollow, remote
alike from the terrors of Nature and the influences
of the external world.</p>

<p>The following day varies the character of the
range, exposed to every vicissitude of temperature
and climate. White billows of fog beat upon the
mountain tops like a silent sea, and blot out the
landscape with an impenetrable veil. Thunder
echoes through the rocky caves with incessant
reverberations, and rain settles down in a drenching
flood. The chill of the wooden Hotel penetrates to
the bone; enthusiasm wanes below zero, and even
scorching Sourabaya appears preferable to this wet
and windy refuge on the storm-swept heights. The
hurricane proves brief in proportion to the violence
displayed, and the walk to Poespo at dawn, behind
the baggage-coolie, is a vision of delight. Violet
mountains lean against the pale blue of a rain-washed
sky, tjewara and teak glisten with jewelled
lustre, and the Tengger, bathed in amethystine
light, lifts itself above the world as the realm of
purity and peace, ever revealed and prophesied by
the glory of mountain scenery.</p>

themselves on the original stock, after those age-long
wanderings across the Southern seas which
probably coincided with the westward march from
Central Asia, whereby primeval man fulfilled the
decrees of destiny.</p>

<p>A long pull in a rickety <i>sampan</i> across the
harbour of Sourabaya involves numerous collisions
with fruit-boats, canoes, and rafts, before reaching
the steamer in the offing. Intervals of comparative
safety permit cursory observation of the gorgeously-painted
<i>praus</i> with upturned stern, curving bamboo
masts, and striped sails, the outline of the
gaudy boats accentuated by a black line, and
producing the effect of huge shells tossing on the
tide. The green isle of Madoera, and the level
morasses of Eastern Java, bound the wide harbour,
the blue cloud of the distant Tengger soaring
abruptly on the horizon. The ship becomes our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>home for a month, and affords a welcome relief from
divers struggles on land, involved by a dual language,
official red tape, and native incompetence. A
brilliant sunset flames across the heavens, and we
glide across a golden sea as a fitting prelude to
unknown realms of enchantment. The dreamful calm
of the two days' passage obliterates the memory of
bygone difficulties and perturbations, the interval
between past and future experiences falling like
refreshing dew on the weary spirit, and increasing
the receptive capacity required for the assimilation
of new impressions. The vast extent of the Malay
Archipelago, and the stupendous size of the
principal islands, comes as a fresh revelation to
travellers whose ideas have been limited by vague
recollections of schoolroom geography. The seven
hundred miles of Java's length, Sumatra's vast
extent of fourteen hundred miles, the area of Borneo
equalling that of France and Germany combined,
and the fact of Celebes, for which we are bound,
exceeding the dimensions of Norway and Sweden,
convey startling suggestions of the limitless space
occupied by the great Equatorial group. The palms
and flowers of myriad smaller isles break the blue
monotony of these summer seas traversed by the
Malay wanderers of olden days, striving to sail
beyond the sunset, and to overtake that visionary
ideal flitting ever before them, and luring them on
with the fairy gold of unfulfilled desires.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>At length the high blue peaks of central Celebes
pierce the silver mists of a roseate dawn, and beyond
a cluster of coral islets, the white town of Makassar
gleams against a green background of palms. Miles
of brown <i>campongs</i> fringe the shore, but the gay
scene on the wooden wharves at first occupies
undivided attention. <i>Sarongs</i> of crimson, orange,
purple, or boldly-contrasting plaids, enhance the
deep bronze of native complexion, the ample folds
of the wide skirts drawn up above the knees. High
turbans of white or red cambric, elaborately twisted,
add dignity to the stately figures, deeply-cut features
and hawk noses denoting Arab origin, for the
Makassarese is a lineal descendant of the Moslem
pirates, once the terror of these island-studded seas.
Proud, courageous, and passionately addicted to
adventurous travel in far-off lands, these sturdy
islanders have little in common with the inert
races of Java. The normal Malay element appears
extinguished by the fiery superstructure of Arab
nature, retaining the vindictive and fanatical traits
of ancestral character. The women, in rainbow
garb, use their floating <i>slandangs</i> as improvised
<i>yashmaks</i>, holding the red and yellow folds before
their faces in approved Moslem fashion, when
passing a man. Makassar, formerly ruled by a line
of powerful princes as an independent fief, but now
subject to a Dutch Governor, has become the capital
of Celebes, and occupies an important commercial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>position. The wharves are filled with bales of
<i>copra</i>, mother-of-pearl shells, plumage of native
birds, dried fish, bundles of rattan, and precious
woods from the primeval forests of the interior.
The boom of the fisherman's drum echoes across the
water in constant reverberations, a secularised relic
of the religious past, originally serving the purpose
of the Mohammedan call to prayer, but now
fulfilling the prosaic office of signalling the arrival
or departure of boats, though the devout mariner
still appeals by drum to the Heavenly Powers for
fair weather and a good haul of fish. The official
buildings of Makassar, including the Dutch Governor's
palace, face a green <i>aloon-aloon</i>, flanked by
superb avenues of kanari and tamarind trees. The
hoary fort, scarcely distinguishable from the solid
rock which supports it, was captured from the King
of Goa by a Dutch admiral, who thrust his sword
through an adjacent cocoanut palm, to symbolise
his intention of piercing the hearts of all who
resisted the Treaty afterwards drawn up. The
sword and cocoanut now form part of the heraldic
arms belonging to Makassar.</p>

<p>Local costume affords a continuous feast of
colour, and streets and avenues appear like moving
tulip beds, the broad blue sky and dazzling sunshine
of this tropical land intensifying every glowing tint
of robe, fruit, and flower. In the umber shadows of
dusky <i>tokos</i>, gold-beaters fashion those red-gold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>ornaments rich in barbaric beauty, for which
Makassar has ever been renowned. Portuguese art
glorifies native workmanship, and the Dutch carry
on the traditions of the past, merely simplifying the
old methods by introducing modern tools to lighten
the labour of production. Silken scarves, and
elaborately-painted <i>battek</i>, woven with gold and
silver thread, swing from the black rafters of dim
corridors, and countless treasures of the deep, in
shells and coral of rich and delicate colouring,
manifest the infinite variety of Nature's handiwork.
From the crowded lanes, with their busy markets
and hybrid population, we drive through the long
line of <i>campongs</i> bordering the palm-fringed coast.
The bamboo walls of the fragile houses, standing
on stilts or rocking on poles in the rippling sea,
show a multitude of fantastic designs, the broad
roofs of thatched grass or plaited palm-leaves
extending in penthouse eaves above carven panels
let into the gables. A riot of glorious vegetation
frames and overshadows the clustering huts of
deftly-woven cane. Dark faces peer through the
narrow slits of bamboo window-spaces, but Makassar
pride contains the elements of self-respect, and
though the stranger attracts a certain amount of
interest, no discourtesy mars the pleasure of
exploration. A red road beneath towering palms,
skirts rice-fields and bamboo thickets to the beautiful
ford of the Tello, a broad river flowing between vast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>woods of cocoanut and bread-fruit trees, with only a
tiny dug-out, steered by a brown boy in a scarlet
turban, to dispel the loneliness of the scene. The
vicinity of Makassar offers no special characteristics
beyond those of a tropical garden, but the changing
aspects of native life provide subjects of unceasing
interest. To-day a great Chinese festa takes place,
which attracts all the inhabitants of town and
<i>campong</i>, for amusements are scarce on these distant
shores, and no questions of race or faith complicate
the determination to secure a share in the pleasures
of the ceremony. When the usual burst of squibs
and crackers, lighting of bonfires, and tossing of
joss-papers into the air, marks the commencement of
the holiday, spectators line the roads, climb the
trees, and crowd the fiat roofs of Portuguese houses.
The afternoon is the children's portion of the
festival, and the little bedizened figures, with rouged
faces, tinsel crowns, and spangled robes, bestride
grotesque wooden dragons, fishes, and birds,
brilliantly painted, and drawn on wheels by masked
men in robes of pink and green. A crowd of high-class
babies, also bedizened and spangled, follows
in perambulators wreathed with flowers, and pushed
by their Chinese nurses. Hideous gods in glittering
robes, and appalling demons painted in black and
scarlet, bring up the rear of the long procession,
which traverses every street and lane of the Chinese
<i>campong</i>, the open houses displaying the lighted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>altars and tutelary gods of Buddhist and Taoist
creed, for the mystic philosophy of the Eastern sages
materialises into grossest realism by passing through
the crucible of Chinese thought.</p>

<p>A visit to the so-called "Kingdom of Goa" fills
up our last day in Makassar. The Palace of the
tributary Sultan, ten miles from the capital, consists
of steep-roofed houses built upon huge trunks of
forest trees, and connected by carved galleries and
crumbling stairs with the Harem at the back of the
main edifice. Squalid women in blue yashmaks loll
on the crazy verandah, whence a native secretary
marshals us through the dusty and ruinous building.
The Sultan, taking to the hills as a necessary
precaution after inciting his subjects to rebellion
against the Dutch, has just been captured, but,
whether by accident or design, fell over a cliff, and
until his dead body is brought back to receive the
Mohammedan rites of burial, the royal residence
remains in charge of the police. The grass-grown
road to the decaying Palace intersects the rambling
and sordid village of Goa, the feudal appanage of
the sorry chieftain, a perpetual thorn in the side of
the Dutch Government. The surrounding country
appears almost a solitude, the silence stirred by the
song of the distant surf, the chirping of myriad
grasshoppers, and the ceaseless clash of waving
palms in the breeze which steals up from the sea.
A quaint water-castle, shaped like a Chinese junk,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>stands on a rock in a fish-pond reflecting the rosy
sky, and the fretted marble of a beautiful Arabian
tomb gleams from a clump of white-starred
<i>sumboya</i> exhaling incense on the air. As the
magic and mystery of night shroud Makassar in a
mantle of gloom, the surrounding sea becomes a
vision of phosphorescent flame to the furthest
horizon. The sheet-lightning of the tropical sky
repeats the wonders of the deep, the glamour of
romance gilds the prose of reality, and we apprehend
that spirit of wondering awe which breathes through
the records of old-world voyagers across uncharted
oceans, when witnessing the phenomena of Nature
in the sanctuary of her power, before Science had
torn the veil from the mystic shrine.</p>

<p>The steamer's course follows the bold and
mountainous coast; steep cliffs alternate with forest-clad
ravines, the purple ranges of the foreground
melting into the azure crests of soaring peaks.
Skilful navigation is required in threading the blue
water-lanes of the Spermunde group, the scores of
palm-clad islets like bouquets of verdure thrown on
the tranquil sea. The wicker-work <i>campongs</i> of the
fishing population form a ring round each white
beach of sparkling coral sand. The black bow of the
"Bromo," a ship which broke her back on a reef
twenty years ago, stands high above the treacherous
rocks, and accentuates the vivid colouring of water
and foliage. At Par&eacute;-Par&eacute;, a native <i>campong</i> in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>deep bay at the edge of a forest, the steamer stops
to discharge cargo, and affords an opportunity of
landing. A gay crowd lines the shore of the
picturesque village, the houses of palm-thatched
bamboo adorned with carved ladders and upcurving
eaves of white wood. One of the numerous military
expeditions to turbulent Celebes has lately been
successful, and the <i>campong</i>, where every hut was
closed for a year in consequence of the local Rajah
forcing his people to join in his insurrection, has at
last been re-opened, though under a guard of Dutch
and Malay troops. A brown bodyguard of native
children, mainly clad in silver chains and medals,
escorts the strangers with intense delight to a shabby
little mosque, where a Dervish, in the orange turban
rewarding a pilgrim to Mecca, beats a big drum in
the stone court. The little savages encountered at
Mandja on the following day seem equally free from
clothes and cares, but Europeans, though possessing
the charm of novelty, are regarded with awe; a
sudden stop, a word, or even a lifted hand, sufficing
to make the whole juvenile population take to their
heels, and hide among the palms and bananas until
a sudden impulse of fresh curiosity banishes fear.
Clothing is at a discount, but ornaments of brass,
silver, and coloured beads, are evidently indispensable.
Natural flowers, like immense red fuchsias
with long white bells, serve as ear-rings, and scarlet
caps adorn the sleek black heads of the elder girls.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>An <i>al fresco</i> picnic party from the hills occupies a
green mound, and boils a kettle on sticks of flaming
bamboo, though a stray spark might easily burn
down the entire <i>campong</i>. A great part of Celebes
is uninhabited and uncultivated, but the tribes of the
interior, warlike and treacherous, have never been
completely subjugated. The slave trade flourishes
among these lonely hills, murder and violence are
rife; the methods of warfare, comprising poisoned
arrows, and bullets containing splinters of glass,
denote absolute barbarism, and the enormous island,
which ought to be a field of emigration for some of
Java's twenty-seven millions, except for the coast
<i>campongs</i> and the rice-grounds of the far interior,
remains one of the waste places of the earth, in spite
of a perfect climate and a teeming soil.</p>

<p>Day by day the scenery becomes more wild and
dreary; the forests disappear, and the sun-baked
hills encroach on the low brushwood beyond the
white beaches of coves and inlets, without any sign
of habitation. An atmosphere of crystalline purity
discloses the highest range of the interior, a long
chain of azure peaks. Our course traverses league
upon league of melancholy solitude, emphasised
rather than relieved by the brilliant sunlight and
balmy breezes playing over this realm of neglected
possibilities, where the wants of countless sufferers
might be abundantly supplied. Anchoring for an
hour in the deep blue bay of Tontoli, we come once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>more into the haunts of men, and two picturesque
<i>campongs</i> buried in cocoa-palms beneath the wooded
mountains of Tomini are pointed out as exclusively
peopled by descendants of the pirates who infested
this western coast of Celebes. From this point the
interest of the cruise increases. Pretty <i>campongs</i>
line the shore of every sheltered creek. Boats of
quaint form and colour push off to meet the steamer,
quickly surrounded by <i>sampans</i>, <i>blotos</i> (the native
canoes), or carved and painted skiffs, all manned by
an amphibious race in Nature's suit of brown, which
renders the wearers indifferent to overturned boats,
water-logged <i>blotos</i>, and collapsing rafts, though
the encouraging statements of our Malay crew as
to the warmth and shallowness of the water in case
of any contretemps, is less reassuring to the
travellers who venture shoreward on the risky craft.
The loan of the captain's boat makes the visit to
Dongalla an experience of unalloyed pleasure, but
the people appear morose and sullen. A dignified
youth, in purple turban and checked <i>sarong</i>,
attempts to do the honours of his native place, but
his comrades, oppressed by vague suspicions, close
the heavy doors of their wooden houses, and peep
through the interstices of the bamboo shutters as
we thread the narrow alleys, escorted by the deck
steward. A more genial crowd welcomes us to the
palm-groves of Palehle, where a light-hearted bodyguard
of children shows us every nook and corner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>of the brown <i>campong</i>, with smiling faces and
merry laughter. The heart-whole mirth of these
little savages might brighten the saddest soul.
Living in the present, with no artificial wants to
create dissatisfaction, and free from the pains or
penalties of poverty, as experienced in Northern
climes, the simple life close to the heart of Nature
suggests ideas of Eden's unshadowed joy. Amid
the treasures of memory garnered during the
winter's wanderings through the Malay Archipelago,
the unclouded merriment which endows these
children of Nature remains as the deepest impression
stamped on the memory of the Western pilgrim.
European childhood, at the best and brightest,
but faintly approaches this spontaneous gaiety, the
special attribute of untutored souls in a world of
primal innocence.</p>

<p>At Soemalata the steep declivities of wooded
mountains enclose the harbour, and a narrow pass
leads to the gold mines, where the process of
smelting and separating the ore takes place in a
primitive series of conduits, sluices, mills, and
pounding machines. The gold concession granted
by the local Rajah prospers in European hands, but
the barbaric chieftain adheres to the ancient custom
of having the gold washed from the river sand by
his own slaves. The English engineer of the mines
hails a compatriot with delight, and his explanation
of the complicated machinery ends with a welcome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>invitation to tea in his pretty bungalow. A solitary
Englishman is frequently found stationed in the
remotest outposts of civilisation throughout the
Malay Archipelago, enduring a life of unexampled
loneliness with the tenacity and determination
inherent in national character. The oft-receding
vision of a successful future inspires the dauntless
heart less than a sense of present duty, and these
exiles from the social ties of nation and kindred
possess special claims on sympathy and remembrance.
Lovely lanes of palm and banana,
brightened by trees of crimson poinsettia, wind
upward to the hills, and a cluster of green islets
gems the blue waters; the scarlet-stemmed Banka
palm offering a glowing contrast to the sweeping
emerald of the feathery fronds. The little
settlement of Kwandang, with a gold <i>fabrik</i>
occupying a wooded islet, completes the circuit of
the western coast, for the North-Eastern Cape comprises
a distinctive province, requiring a separate
chapter. Intervening mountains, with jagged cliffs
and towering summits, rise like Titanic fortresses
from the creaming surf which washes the yellow
bastions, leaving no space for the wicker <i>campongs</i>,
impermanent as a child's house of cards, but
perpetually rebuilt in identical fashion, and never
developing into substantial dwellings, or adjusted
on the new lines required by varieties of environment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE MINAHASA.</h3>


<p>Steaming slowly through the phosphorescent seas of
the starlit night, we anchor at dawn in the forest-lined
bay of Amoerang, the principal harbour of
the Minahasa. The picturesque Northern Cape of
Celebes contains a population differing in origin and
character from all other races of the vast island, and
conveys the idea of a distinctive country. The
mountain panorama of shelving ridges and fretted
promontories, breaking the outlines of the rocky
coast with infinite variety, culminates in the
chiselled contours of volcanic peaks, cutting sharply
into the silvery blue of a stainless sky. Amoerang,
half-buried in sago-palms, on the green rim of the
secluded haven, shows slight resemblance to the
<i>campongs</i> generally encountered on the western
coast. Wooden cottages, though built on piles of
wood or stone, and thatched with <i>atap</i> (plaited
palm leaves) possess many features in common with
the screened and balconied dwellings of Japan.
The people, in aspect and feature, also convey
suggestions of the Japanese origin ascribed to them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>for ancient traditions assert that the Minahasa was
colonised by an Asiatic tribe, driven out of Formosa
by native savages, in one of those wild raids upon
the peaceful maritime population which drove them
to face the perils of an unknown sea, rather than
fall into the ruthless hands of the bloodthirsty
aborigines who inhabited the forests and mountains
of the interior. Many of the hapless exiles perished
through hunger, thirst, storm, and shipwreck of
their slightly-built craft, during the long wanderings
which ended as though by chance for the survivors,
in the distant Minahasa. The Malay element in
those Japanese refugees, displayed the usual characteristics
of skill in boat-building and navigation,
together with that accurate observation of natural
phenomena which alone could compensate for the
lack of scientific knowledge. The women, with
oblique eyes and oval faces, wear the gay <i>sarong</i> and
white <i>kabaja</i> customary in Eastern Java. The
men, in shapeless gowns and wide trousers, with
broad hats of battered straw on their close-cropped
hair, afford a sorry spectacle of unbecoming and
disorderly attire, conveying grotesque hints of
Japanese ideas beneath the squalid ugliness overlaying
them. The fishermen, conveniently unclad
for the necessities of their calling, wear only a yellow
or scarlet waist-cloth, the bright touch of colour
emphasising the deep bronze of their slight but
athletic forms. The people of the Minahasa,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Christianised after the Calvinistic methods of Dutch
and German missionaries a century ago, have always
been specially favoured by the Government of
Holland, and large sums are annually expended in
improving the status of this distant colony. The
making of roads, the building of schools and
churches, and the improvement of social conditions,
are liberally catered for, not only for the advantage
of the Minahasa, but that no excuse may exist for
any rebellion against such paternal rule. Tribal
insurrections continually recur in the great Archipelago,
where a storm in a teacup often swells into
dangerous proportions, and the peaceful adherence
of the Minahasa to the powers that be becomes an
important factor in turbulent Celebes. The race,
so strangely amalgamated with alien interests, shows
the apathy of a temperament incapable of developement
on foreign lines, though unable to resist the
pressure imposed upon it. The pretty <i>campong</i>
seems silent as the grave. No native <i>warongs</i>,
or restaurants, enliven the straight roads with their
merry crowds or cheerful gossip, and sellers of
food and drink, whose cries echo through the streets
of Makassar, are unknown in this northern port,
where even the arrival of the fortnightly steamer
fails to excite much interest in the public mind.</p>

<p>A rash determination to drive across the Minahasa,
and pick up the boat at Menado, involves
unimagined difficulties. Heavy waggons drawn by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>brown <i>sappies</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, bullocks), which travel at
the rate of two miles an hour, suffice for native use
in remote Amoerang, but at length a dilapidated
gig, with two sorry steeds harnessed in tandem
fashion by sundry bits of old rope, is produced.
Having frequently experienced the pace accomplished
by many a Timor pony of emaciated
and dejected aspect, faith accepts even this
unpromising team for the long drive of thirty miles.
Quaint <i>campongs</i>, with bamboo fences and curiously
arched gateways, flank the woodland road. Each
little garden flames with red poinsettia, purple
convolvulus, and yellow daisies. The latticed
screens pushed back from open verandahs, show
Japanese-looking rooms, furnished with the European
lamps, chairs, and tables, exported by
thousands to the Minahasa, but the same atmosphere
of stagnation broods over these quiet villages, and
even the children, returning from a bamboo schoolhouse
on the edge of the forest, show the staid and
solemn demeanour of their elders. For a few miles
all goes well, with the trifling exception of
occasional breakages in the countless knots of the
rope harness. The last whistle of the steamer floats
upward as she leaves her anchorage, and refusing to
yield to a faint misgiving as to the success of the
present enterprise, eyes and thoughts concentrate
themselves on the increasing beauty of the mountain
road, the living emerald of the rice-fields, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>the picturesque mills for husking the grain, which
give special character to this unique district of
Celebes. Suddenly the rickety conveyance comes
to a full stop, and a kicking match begins, the
plunging ponies refusing to budge an inch. The
incapable Jehu implores his fare's consent to an
immediate return, but meets with an inexorable
refusal, the halting Malay sentences eked out with
an unmistakable pantomime of threats and warnings.
The driver's whip, supplemented by an
English umbrella, produces no effect on the obtuse
animals, which have to be led, or rather hauled, on
their unwilling way. One obstreperous steed
becomes so unmanageable that it becomes necessary
to hitch him to the back of the cart, at the imminent
risk of overturning it, in his determination to thwart
his companion's enforced progress. Mile after mile
the wearisome struggle continues. Even a lumbering
bullock waggon passes us again and again, in
the numerous stoppages required for fresh conflict.
The endless hours of the weary day drag on like a
terrible nightmare, but a descent into a profound
ravine of these mountain solitudes at length enables
the driver to start the team at a rate which makes
it impossible for them to stop, and he vaults lightly
into his place as we spin merrily downhill. Our
troubles are not over, for on the next upward grade
the old game of rearing, backing, and futile attempts
at buck-jumping, begins again. Despairing eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>rest on a thatched booth at the roadside, containing
a row of bottles hung up by a string, with the
bamboo tube for coins. Holding the ropes, and
currying favour with the ponies by leading them to a
patch of grass, it becomes possible for the boy to
leave them for a sorely-needed drink of the sago-wine.
The fiendish animals try to upset the cart,
and the fight recommences for the fiftieth time, but
the brown huts of a <i>campong</i> in a cactus thicket
inspire hope, and after a furious battle in the street,
to the intense delight of the Japanese-looking people,
a man comes to the rescue with a stout pony. The
boy mounts one battered steed, the other is left
behind in a hospitable stable, and we trot briskly on
through lovely scenery of forest and mountain to
Kanas, at the head of the beautiful lake of Tondano,
hitherto seen in glimpses at an immense depth
between encircling peaks. Wearied almost to
stupefaction by eleven hours of a combat, after
which victory seems scarcely less ghastly than
defeat, we would gladly remain for the night at the
little Rest House of Kanas, but prudence compels
us to push on to Tondano, at the other end of the
lake, while a capable pony remains at disposal. The
lake road is a vista of entrancing loveliness, overhung
by arching bamboos and great sago-palms, the
vanguard of the forest which clothes the lower spurs
of the purple mountain ranges, shutting off the long
blue lake from the outside world. A rudely-built
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><i>bloto</i>, merely the hollowed trunk of a tree,
crosses the water, with a torch flickering at the
prow, for the sun has set, and the crimson afterglow
begins to fade from the serrated crests of the
opposite heights. The ripple of the water in the
reeds at the edge of the road, and the sigh of the
evening breeze, fluttering the leaves and creaking
the yellow canes of the great bamboos, alone stir the
silence, which comes as a welcome relief after the
toil and excitement of the day; but alas! we have
all forgotten the perils of the road at nightfall, and
in the sudden darkness, deepened by the shadowy
trees, a false step might precipitate cart and
passengers into the deep water. Any advance
becomes dangerous on the winding way, which
follows every curve of the irregular shore, so a halt
is called, while the boy rides on towards some
twinkling lights denoting a lakeside <i>campong</i>. After
a long wait, he returns in triumph with three
matches and a piece of flaming tow in a bottle. By
observing due precaution, we can now follow his
guidance, while he holds out the flaring light
with extended arm. As we turn round the foot of
the lake into a raised causeway above fields of
ripening rice, the full moon comes up behind the
sombre hills, and transfigures the night with a
sparkling flood of silver glory. We reach the white
Dutch town of Tondano as the clock strikes ten,
but everyone is in bed at this dissipated hour, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>difficulty is experienced even in getting admission to
the little Hotel, though the delight of finding an
English-speaking landlord atones for a somewhat
ungracious reception after a long and painful
pilgrimage, which should serve as a solemn warning
against the rash attempt to penetrate the wilds of
the Minahasa under native guidance.</p>

<p>Tondano, with houses and verandahs gleaming
in spotless whiteness among green spaces and
luxuriant trees, appears a typical Dutch town,
incongruous but picturesque. The absolute purity
and transparency of the atmosphere give value and
intensity to every shade of colour, and the scarlet
hybiscus flowers show the incandescent glow belonging
rather to lamps than to blossoms. The river
Tondano forms a series of lovely cascades below the
town, situated four miles from the lake at the present
time, for the marshy flats have been reclaimed as
rice-grounds, thus somewhat diminishing the stretch
of water. The steep drive down to Menado offers a
succession of lovely views. The little port, in a nest
of verdure, encircles the azure bay, where our
steamer, merely a white speck in the distance, lies
at anchor. A turn of the road discloses a glimpse
of the mountain lake, a sheet of sapphire sparkling
in the morning sun, but retrospective thoughts in
this instance convey pain as well as pleasure, for
"mounting ambition" has for once "o'erleapt
itself," and failure counterbalances success. Menado,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>divided by the river, is inhabited by two distinct
tribes of the mysterious colonists who came from
the farthest East to these unknown shores. The
ubiquitous Chinaman has found a firm footing in the
northerly port of Celebes, and the splendidly-carved
dragons of a stately temple, rich in ornaments of
green jade, blue porcelain, and elaborate brass-work,
denote the important status of the wealthy
community. A busy <i>passer</i> supplies the usual
pictures of native life, but the people of the Minahasa,
here as elsewhere, lack both the gay insouciance
of the South, and the strenuous energy of the
Northern mind, the residuum of apathetic dullness,
deprived of all the salient characteristics which
constitute charm and interest. European houses of
Dutch officials stand in ideal gardens of brilliant
flowers and richest foliage. The little Hotel
Wilhelmina is a paradise of exotic blossoms, but
Menado, apart from a lovely situation, and the usual
riot of glorious verdure which makes every tropical
weed a thing of beauty, offers little inducement for
a prolonged stay. The bay, exposed to contrary
winds and chafed by conflicting currents, tosses in
perpetual turmoil, though a long jetty diminishes the
former difficulties of the stormy passage between
ship and shore. In the amber light of sunset, the
dark mountain ranges stand out with unearthly
clearness. The jagged peaks of Klabat and Soedara
in the background, bringing into prominence the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>grey cliffs and purple ravines of the smoking Lokon.
The wonderful scenery of the Malay Archipelago
seldom lacks that element of terror which enhances
the radiant loveliness of Nature by painting it on a
tragic background of storm and cloud, the
vague suggestion of evanescence intensifying the
mysterious charm with poetic significance. The
receding coast discloses a striking panorama of the
mountain heights piled one upon another, the grey
towers and bastions guarding this narrowing Cape
of the Minahasa, a veritable outpost of Nature,
eternally washed by the restless seas. As the
steamer rounds the savage promontories, and threads
the blue straits formed by two rocky islets at
the northern extremity, the weird and desolate
landscape conveys a strange sense of separation
even from the alien humanity which peoples the far-reaching
peninsula of the Minahasa, and this
northern extremity appears a limitless waste.
Chaotic masses of imperishable granite, splintered
reefs thrusting black spikes through the creaming
surge, and wind-swept cliffs of fantastic form,
characterise the solemn headland, unpainted and
unsung, although the sea-girt sanctuary of Nature
demands interpretation through the terms of Art
and Poetry.</p>

<h3>GORONTALO AND THE EASTERN COAST.</h3>


<p>The steamer's first halt on the wild eastern coast of
Celebes is the gold-mining settlement of Todok,
where the Company's rustic offices of palm-thatched
bamboo border an enchanting bay, with a string of
green islets studding the shoaling blue and purple of
the gleaming depths. Two passengers disembark
for the ebony plantations on the slopes of a volcanic
range, declaring itself by a slight earthquake rocking
the <i>atap</i> shanty, where the ship's officer who
tallies the cargo, offers hospitality until the fierce
heat modifies sufficiently for a stroll.</p>

<p>A dusty and shadeless road leads up into the
wooded hills which bound the prospect, but the
<i>campong</i>, largely consisting of recently-constructed
dwellings, occupied by alien employ&eacute;s in the service
of the Gold Syndicate, offers no inducements for
exploration, and until the launch returns, a shadowy
palm-grove by the wayside makes a welcome retreat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>from the dust and glare, the creaking of innumerable
bullock-waggons, and the shouts of crew and coolies,
disputing over the loading of a raft.</p>

<p>The arrival at Gorontalo in the radiant dawn
provides a more interesting experience. The river
which forms the beautiful harbour, rushes through a
profound ravine of the forest-clad mountains, which
descend sharply to the water's edge. The scene
resembles a Norwegian fiord, translated into tropical
terms of climate and vegetation. A narrow track
climbs the ledges of a cliff behind the brown fishing
<i>campong</i> of Liato, but a rude wharf on the opposite
side affords a less picturesque though safer landing,
for the swirling currents of the swift stream require
more careful navigation than the amphibious boatman,
unembarrassed by clothing, is wont to bestow
on craft or passenger. The spirit of enterprise is
also in abeyance, scotched if not killed by the
struggles of the memorable pilgrimage through the
Minahasa. The quiet haven in the shadow of the
guardian hills looks an ideal haunt of peace. A
Dutch battleship lies at anchor, and the red sails of
a wide-winged <i>prau</i> make broken reflections in
the rippling clearness of the green water. A wooden
bridge crosses the river at the narrow end of the
funnel-shaped harbour, connecting it with the town
in the steaming valley, the usual medley of open
<i>tokos</i> and <i>atap</i> huts, supplemented by two
dubious hotels, a green <i>aloon-aloon</i>, and a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>stone houses denoting the presence of the European
element. The original inhabitants of Gorontalo are
of Alfoer race&mdash;dark, glum, and forbidding. How
this ancient stock, indigenous to some of the
southern islands in the Malay Archipelago, wandered
from thence to distant Celebes has not been satisfactorily
accounted for. The records of savage
tribes depend on oral tradition, but the outlines of
an oft-told tale become blurred and dim during the
lapse of ages, when the mental calibre of the racial
type lacks normal acumen. The graces of life are
ignored by the Alfoer woman, her mouth invariably
distorted by the red lump of betel-nut, accommodated
with difficulty, and rendering silence
imperative. Her bowed shoulders become deformed
with the heavy loads perpetually borne, for the rising
trade of Gorontalo supplies the men with more
congenial employment than the field work, which
frequently becomes the woman's province. A
straight road between crowding palms crosses a wide
rice-plain, opening out of the cleft carved by the
mountain river, and leads to the curious Lake of
Limbotto, a green mass of luxuriant water-weeds,
the dense vegetation solidifying into floating islands
of verdure, intersected by narrow channels, only
navigable to a native <i>bloto</i> skilfully handled, for
Nature alternately builds up and disperses these
flowery oases, blocking up old water-ways and
opening new ones with bewildering confusion.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Buffaloes wallow between the tangled clumps of pink
lotus and purple iris, and wild ducks nest in the
waving sedges, or darken the air in a sudden flight
down the long lake. A noisy market flanks the
water, and bronze figures, in red turbans row gaily-clad
women, laden with purchases, to some distant
<i>campong</i>, reached through the mazes of verdure.
The country <i>passer</i>, a shifting scene of gaudy
colouring, contains greater elements of interest
than commercial Gorontalo, where the native
<i>campong</i> loses individuality in gaining the prosaic
adjuncts of a trading centre. The lovely harbour
dreams in the moonlight as we steam slowly out of
the widening estuary to pick up cargo in the great
bay of Tomini, which sweeps in a mighty curve
round half the Eastern coast of Celebes. The
conical island of Oena-Oena rises sheer from the
waves, the red peak of a lofty volcano composing
the apex of a green pyramid, formed by a forest of
palms. Until six years ago no anchorage for ships
was possible at this forest-clad isle, but a volcanic
eruption deepened the bay, and a thriving trade in
<i>copra</i> was initiated, for the whole surface of
Oena-Oena is clothed with a dense mass of drooping
cocoanut trees. Scattered dwellings nestle in the
thick woods, but no regular <i>campong</i> exists in this
thinly-peopled spot, a vernal Eden set in the
purple sea. The heat of the day, though intense, is
everywhere tempered by the interlacing canopies of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>the feathery fronds, until sunset fuses them into the
vivid transparency of green fire, and a fluttering
zephyr stirs the whispering foliage. The shy brown
people, who at first hide in their <i>atap</i> huts at the
approach of strangers, venture out to see the last of
the departing steamer, which forms the sole link
between barbarism and civilisation, and a month
must elapse before any contact with the outside
world can vary the seclusion of this lonely spot, a
dreamland vision of repose. At Posso, the next port
on Celebes, we land a Dutch officer, bound for the
important barracks on a hill above the straggling
<i>campong</i>, after a successful expedition against the
tree-dwellers, cannibals, and slave-traders of the
interior, still sunk in barbarism. An olive-green
river, infested with crocodiles, flows sluggishly
through rank vegetation into the sea below the
dilapidated huts of the depressing native town. This
forlorn outpost of military duty involves exile from
civilisation, and the risk of occasional raids from the
wild tribes of the surrounding hills.</p>

<p>At Parigi, canopied by spreading palms, the
<i>atap</i> houses, with bamboo rafters strengthening the
fragile walls, stand in neglected gardens, overgrown
with a tangle of flower and foliage. The low tide
makes the dangerous <i>bloto</i> a necessity, though
the hollowed tree, top heavy and water-logged, is in
imminent peril of capsizing every minute of the long
course between ship and shore. Objections to a boat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>upsetting in shallow water being beyond Malay
comprehension, the only way of accomplishing the
transit in safety is by a summary command that two
brown boys should immediately jump overboard to
lighten the rocking craft. Nothing loth, they swim
to shore in our wake, rolling over in the sand to
dry themselves like Newfoundland dogs, and with
less embarrassment on the score of clothing. A
native Queen or Maharanee rules Parigi from her
bamboo palace in the deepest recesses of the adjacent
palm-forest, but she is invisible to her subjects, and
dwells in the seclusion of <i>purdah</i>, possibly a relic
of Indian origin. Her nominal authority proves
insufficient to keep the peace between the native
population and the Dutch, for Parigi has been for
months in a state of insurrection and unrest. Only
a year ago a raid was made on the Eurasian
merchant's office wherein I take shelter from the
noonday sun, and two white men were attacked by
a band who rushed down from the mountains and
cut off their heads. The ringleader of the assassins
is now imprisoned for life in the gaol of Batavia, no
capital punishment being permitted in the Netherlands
India. An immense cargo of <i>copra</i> and
rattan fills a fleet of boats and rafts. The great
stacks of cane cause no annoyance, but the sickening
smell of <i>copra</i> (the dried and shredded cocoanut
used for oil) pervades the ship, and an occasional
cockroach of crab-like dimensions clatters across the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>deck in his coat of mail from a hiding place in the
unsavoury cargo. The philosophic Hollander accepts
these horrors of the tropics with undisturbed composure,
but happily for the peace of the English
passenger, the Malay "room-boy" welcomes a new
idea, and becomes gradually inspired with the
ardour of the chase. Ominous clouds darken over
the Bay of Tomini as we embark once more on the
rolling waters, having completed the circuit of the
vast island, possessing a coast-line of 2,500 miles.
Blue peaks and waving palms recede into the mists
of falling night. We are once more afloat on a
sleeping sea, the restful monotony of wind and
wave enabling indelible impressions of each varying
scene to sink deeply into mind and memory, and
preventing the too rapid succession of travelling
experiences.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<h3>A GLIMPSE OF BORNEO.</h3>


<p>An element of uncertainty attends the cruise among
the Malayan islands, through sudden orders to
include strange ports of call in the programme of
the route. During the stay at Makassar, a cable
from Batavia necessitates a flying visit to Borneo,
and though the d&eacute;tour was made from the western
coast of Celebes, the great sister island demands a
special notice. In steaming thither through the
radiant glory of an Equatorial sunset, strange
atmospheric effects denote fresh variations of climate
and temperature. The rounded horizon, which
suggests the rim of the terrestrial globe, seems
within a stone's throw of the ship, and as the
crimson sun sinks below the sharply-defined curve
outlined by the sea, a glowing hearth of smouldering
embers appears burning on the edge of the water.
The eastern sky blooms into vivid pink from the
reflection of this fiery incandescence, which fades
only to give place to the leaping brightness of
phosphorescent waves, and the nightly pageant of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>tropical skies ablaze with lambent flames of summer
lightning. Morning reveals the dark forests of
mysterious Borneo, rolling back to the misty blue of
a mountain background. The pathless jungles of
teak and iron wood, inextricably tangled by ropes of
liana or ladders of rattan, latticed with creepers
and wreathed with clambering fern, make an
impenetrable barrier between the settlements of the
coast and the unknown interior, where barbarism
still reigns triumphant, and "head-hunting"
remains the traditional sport. Insurmountable
difficulties of transit and progress are reported, even
by the few enthusiastic botanists, who merely
penetrate the outworks of Nature's stronghold in
search of rare orchids, worth more than a king's
ransom if we take into account the sacrifice of life,
and the hardships suffered in wresting these floral
gems from their forest casket. Any complete
exploration of these tropical wilds seems at present
beyond human means and capacities, but even a few
months of the soil and climate of Borneo can transform
a forest clearing into a wilderness of riotous
vegetation, more impassable than that woodland
maze of a century's growth encircling the palace of
the Sleeping Beauty in the loveliest of old-world
fairy tales. Our present quest has no connection
with the mysteries of the interior, and only concerns
itself with the prosaic task of taking in a cargo of
oil, used as the ship's fuel. We steam into a wooded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>bay, beneath a hill covered with the brown <i>atap</i>
bungalows of European colonists. Colossal oil-tanks,
painted red, disfigure the shore. Each tank
holds 4,000 tons of oil, 30,000 tons per month being
the usual export. Kerosene taints the air, but is
considered to be innocuous, and to drive away the
curse of mosquitos. The unimaginable and
ferocious heat makes every step a terror, during a
snail's progress up a wooded road. Sun-hat and
white umbrella scarcely mitigate the scorching rays
on this perilous promenade, but there is only a day
at disposal, and it cannot be wasted. Towards
noon a breeze springs up, and exploration
of the long line of <i>tokos</i> beyond the wharves is
simplified by the spreading eaves of palm-leaf
thatch. A row of workmen's dwellings forms a
prosaic continuation of the <i>campong</i>, inhabited by
a mixed population, chiefly imported to Balik-Papan
in the interests of the oil trade. A chance rencontre
with the Scotch doctor of the European settlement
affords an opportunity of visiting the Oil Refinery,
with the varied distillations, culminating in the great
tank of benzine, a concentration of natural forces
like a liquid dynamite, capable of wrecking the whole
settlement in a moment. Endless precautions and
vigilant care alone secure the safety of Balik-Papan
from the perils incidental to the vast stores of
explosive material. The raw petroleum brought
from the mines of Samarinda, farther down the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>coast, by a fleet of <i>hoppers</i> (the local steamers
which ply round the indented shore), is extracted
by boring a stratum of coal known as "antichine,"
and always containing indications of mineral oil.
Dutch and English Companies work this valuable
product; fortunes are quickly made, and the
industrious inhabitants, absorbed in dreams of a
golden future, appear untroubled by any consciousness
of metaphorically sleeping on the brink of a
volcano. Iced soda-water, and a brief siesta, revive
drooping spirits after the broiling exertions of the
morning, and as the shadows of the palm-trees
lengthen on the edge of the jungle, it becomes
possible to mount the hill behind the wharf to the
picturesque bungalow of another kindly Scot, who
invites me to tea. The pretty tropical dwelling of
plaited <i>atap</i>, through which every precious breath
of air can penetrate, stands in the midst of a
gorgeous thicket, composed of scarlet hybiscus and
yellow Allemanda, the splendid blossoms growing in
wild luxuriance on this sandy soil. The glare of the
sun still requires the <i>atap</i> screens to be closed on
the broad-eaved verandah, but the freshness of the
evening breeze steals into the twilight of the pretty
drawing-room, the simple but refined appointments
of a restful home intensely refreshing after weeks of
ship and hotel existence. The fragrant tea, with
dainty cups and saucers, and the home-made cakes,
seem almost forgotten luxuries, for the amenities of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>British civilisation stop short at Singapore. A cheery
party assembles round the table, and these exiles on
a foreign shore extend the warmest of welcomes to
the stray bird of passage, who will soon leave behind
only the shadowy "remembrance of a guest who
tarrieth but a day." The idea so familiar to the
self-seeking spirit, that "it is not worth while" to
trouble about a passing acquaintance, finds no echo
in this hospitable coterie. To the visitor, the bright
hours of that afternoon, ten thousand miles away
from England, remain as an evergreen memory of
genuine human sympathy, the true "touch of
Nature" linking hearts and lives. A long walk
through the encroaching jungle fills up the day. The
narrow track skirts dark depths of matted foliage,
with strange bird-calls echoing through the gloom.
The phenomenal growth of vegetation in Borneo is
so rapid that a month's neglect in cutting back
branches, and rooting up masses of strangling
creeper, would entirely obliterate the path. In six
months a tree, supposed to be cut down beyond
possibility of resurrection, lately shot up to the
height of seventeen feet, with a girth of several
inches in diameter, so tenacious is the exuberant life
of this irrepressible vegetation, eternally renewing
itself in immortal strength and primeval freshness.
From the edge of the sombre jungle the azure bay,
set in the dark frame of forest and gilded with sunset
light, resembles a Scotch loch at midsummer, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>the poignant counterpart brings a sigh to the lips of
my companion, exiled for years from his Highland
home. A long slow river, navigable for native
craft, widens into an estuary as it approaches the sea,
through the shadowy and impenetrable mazes of
the virgin woods traversed by the winding waterway.
The Dyaks and other wild aborigines of
Borneo still haunt the forest depths, though the
fringe of civilisation drives them further inland, and
some of the local Sultans begin to fraternise with
the settlers, who alone can develope the riches of
the extensive island. At present the northern
territory of Sarawak, successfully governed by an
alien race, finds no adequate counterpart on the
island, though coast towns, springing up at wide
intervals, open small districts to the enterprise of
the European world. Balik-Papan, rising tier above
tier on the dark hillside, and brilliant with a
multitude of flashing lights, looks picturesque as
Naples itself, when we steam away in the gathering
gloom, and the dazzling illumination, reflected in the
tranquil sea, appears a miraculous transfiguration.
Oil tanks and warehouses, refineries and factories,
vanish under the veil of night, and only a fairy
vision of unearthly brightness remains as a final
recollection of our brief visit to Borneo.</p>

<h2>THE MOLUCCAS.</h2>
<hr class="hr4" />

<h3>TERNATE, BATJAN, AND BOEROE.</h3>


<p>The Birds of Paradise (known by the Malay as
<i>Manuk Devata</i>, "birds of God") were traditionally
represented as lured from their celestial home by the
spicy perfume of these enchanted isles, from whence
perpetual incense steals across the sea, and rises
heavenward with intoxicating fragrance. A Dutch
naturalist in 1598 says, "These birds of the sun live
in air, and never alight until they die, having neither
feet nor wings, but fall senseless with the fragrance
of the nutmeg." Linnaeus asserts that "they feed
on the nectar of flowers, and show an equal variety of
colour, blue and yellow, orange and green, red and
violet." Portuguese naturalists also represent the
<i>passaros de sol</i> as footless, their mode of flight
concealing the extremities. Birds of Paradise were
articles of tribute from native chiefs, and a sacred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>character belonged to the feathered tribe, wheeling
between earth and sky above the spicy groves of the
alluring Moluccas. This island group, for ages the
coveted prize of European nations, exercised an
irresistible attraction on Arabia and Persia. Various
expeditions were organised, and in the ninth century
Arab sages discovered the healing virtues of nutmeg
and mace, as anodynes, embrocations, and condiments.
A record remains of a certain Ibn Amram,
an Arabian physician, whose uncontrolled passion for
the <i>nux moschata</i> overthrew his reason. The
story, continually quoted as a warning to subsequent
explorers of the Spice Islands, has apparently kept
his memory green, for no previous details of his
career have come down to us. Eastern spices were
favourite medicines in Persia during the tenth
century, and fifty years later the <i>karoun aromatikon</i>
was added to the Pharmacopeia of Europe.
In <small>A.D.</small> 1400, Genoa and Barcelona became the
principal spice markets, though the attention of
Northern Europe had been directed to the Moluccas
by those voyages of Marco Polo which, especially in
lands of fog and snow, fired popular imagination with
myriad visions of realised romance. Cam&ouml;ens, in
the Lusiad, chanted the praises of the <i>verde noz</i>
in those poetic groves, which he regarded as a new
garden of Hesperides, when the magic lure of an
untravelled distance, and the dreamful wonder of an
untracked horizon, wove their spells over the mind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>of an awakening world. Powers of observation and
comparison were still untrained and untried; superstition
was rife, and a necromantic origin was
frequently ascribed to the unfamiliar products of the
mystic East. Portugal, in the zenith of her
maritime power, became the first European trader
in the Southern Seas, and in <small>A.D.</small> 1511 Albuquerque
reached the Moluccas, but was quickly followed by
the Spaniards under their great Emperor Charles V.
Incessant war continued for the possession of "the
gold-bearing trees," until Spain and Portugal, united
by a common danger, combined their forces to
exclude the northern nations from any share in the
coveted spoil. The rage for spices spread throughout
Europe, and kindled a fire of international
animosity which lasted for centuries. In <small>A.D.</small> 1595
the unwieldy Dutch ships started on a perilous
voyage round the Cape, to trace the unknown path
to the mysterious Moluccas, described as "odorous
with trees of notemuge, sending of their fragrance
across the sea on the softe breath of the south
winde," and Holland, at the climax of her power,
eventually secured the monopoly of spices. The
islands so fiercely contested were twice owned by
England, but finally relinquished in that readjustment
of power necessitated by the fall of Napoleon.
Although the Moluccas were declared open to the flag
of every friendly nation in 1853, it was not until
twenty years later that every vestige of monopoly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>disappeared, and the Spice Islands were liberated
from the political chicanery of rival Powers. Peace
brooded at last over the sea-girt Elysium, where
"Nature tries her finest touch," and in the green
shades of these "ultimate islands," the tumult of
the world died away into silence. Old German and
Flemish ballads borrow quaint anachronisms from
that sylvan sanctuary of incense-laden sweetness,
which coloured the thoughts and dreams of contemporary
poets, and added exotic traits to their
descriptions of northern scenery. "The nutmeg
boughs in the Garden of Love," droop over the fair-haired
Teutonic maiden in her home amid German
pine-forests, and she gathers "the scented fruit of
gold," as a worthy <i>gage d'amour</i> for her stalwart
Saxon lover, with that picturesque incongruity of
poetical license permitted to medi&aelig;val versifiers.
The canvas of many an early painter depicts the
sacred figures of Madonna and Child on an incongruous
background of German or Italian landscape,
and the medi&aelig;val poet seldom hesitates to enrich his
verse with whimsical allusions, full of fantastical
inaccuracy, but valuable as revelations of current
thoughts and ideas. Only a slight sketch of the
prolonged conflict waged for centuries round the
nutmeg groves of the remote Moluccas is possible in
this little record, but even the briefest account of the
Spice Islands demands mention of evidence proving
the value attached to the precious "fruit of gold,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>then outweighing every other product of tropical
climes in popular estimation.</p>

<p>Three volcanic peaks tower up before us on
reaching Ternate, the first of the Molucca group.
This mountain chain includes types representing
every period of volcanic agency. The smoking cone
of Ternate slopes in sweeping contours to the blue
strait unbroken by bay or creek, and smaller
satellites flank the central height, grooved by wooded
gorges. The serrated ridge of Tidore, the opposite
island, culminates in the red pinnacle formed by a
fresh pyramid of lava above the ruined wall of a
broken crater, the gap creating a sheltered inlet,
where a fishing boat with yellow sails skims like a
huge butterfly across the shimmering purple of the
flowing tide. The fretted turquoise of the further
range rises on the great island of Halmaheira,
inhabited by an Alfoer population of Papuan origin,
but beyond the scope of the present cruise. The
port of Ternate, on the southern slope of the volcano,
shows the pointed gables of palm-thatched dwellings
rising from masses of glorious greenery, brightened
by purple torrents of bougainvillea, or golden-flowered
ansena trees, wreathed and roped with a
gorgeous tangle of many-coloured creepers. The
breath of heavily-scented flowers mingles with the
pungent sweetness of clove and nutmeg. An
avenue of dadap trees skirts the shore, with varied
foliage of amber and carmine. The dark figures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>sauntering in the shade, and clad in rose-colour,
azure, or orange, add deeper notes to the symphony
of colour, only marred by the white-washed Dutch
conventicle, like an emphatic protest against Nature's
response to her Creator. Ruined arches and pillars
of white Portuguese houses, standing in a wilderness
of verdure amid tumbled heaps of stone and concrete,
testify to the earthquakes which have continually
wrecked the little port. The mixed population
includes Chinese, Arabs, and Malays. The original
native race also contains Malay, Dutch, and
Portuguese elements, European descent resulting
here as elsewhere in darkening the native brown of
the pure-blooded Ternatian to ebony blackness in the
second and succeeding generations.</p>

<p>The discovery of an English-speaking schoolmistress
simplifies the day's itinerary, which
begins with the thatched palace or <i>kedaton</i>
of the Sultan. The tiered roofs of the royal
<i>Messighit</i> rise above the <i>atap</i> dwellings of the
rustic Court, still professing a slack Mohammedanism.
The Dutch territory includes the
Chinese and Oriental <i>campongs</i> divided by Fort
Orange, but though the palmy days of Ternate's
hereditary Ruler have long since passed away, he
retains a shadowy authority over a limited area. Sir
Francis Drake, on one of his romantic voyages,
touched at Ternate in the early days of the 16th
century, and in graphic words records his amazement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>at "the fair and princely show" of this barbaric
potentate, who sat robed in cloth of gold, beneath a
gold-embroidered canopy, and wore "a crown of
plaited golden links." Chains of diamonds and
emeralds clasped his swarthy neck, and on the royal
right hand "there shone a big and perfect blue
turky." This regal splendour was attained by
monopoly of the Spice Trade, the incalculable profits
inducing Europeans to exchange fortunes of gold and
jewels with native magnates. The Dutch, when
seizing the islands, often compelled the local Sultans
to destroy acres of spice-bearing trees, in order to
concentrate the focus of commerce. The thriving
industries of <i>copra</i>, rattan, and <i>damar</i> (the gum used
in making varnish) were increased tenfold by the
abolition of private spice-trading, and by emancipation
of the slaves in 1861, when the Dutch
Government placed the liberated population under
police surveillance, compelling each individual to
prove honest acquirement of the slender means
necessary for subsistence. Contact with the world
begins to sharpen native intelligence, already
heightened by the fusion of European blood with the
island race, and external cleanliness being enforced
systematically in Dutch territory, the concrete cottages
which alternate with the thatched dwellings are
dazzlingly white, the diligent sweeping and watering
at fixed hours helping to energise the indolent
people of the Moluccas. The warm air, redolent of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>spices and flowers, the riotous profusion of richest
foliage, and the depth of colour in sea and sky, imbue
Ternate with the glow and glamour of fairyland.
Bright faces and gay songs manifest that physical
<i>joie de vivre</i> of which Northern nations know so
little. The grass screens hanging before the open
houses are drawn to keep off the burning sun, but
the twang of lutes (a relic of the Portuguese
occupation), and the sound of laughter echo
from the dusky interiors. A forest of mangos,
mangosteens, bread-fruit, and cocoa-palms, extends
between the town and Fort Teloko, the first
Portuguese stronghold, and now a rocky outpost of
Fort Orange, the headquarters of the Dutch troops.
Beyond shadowy nutmeg groves lies the Laguna, a
volcanic lake between mountain and sea. In the
poetic Moluccas one draws closer to the warm heart
of Nature than in any other part of the vast Archipelago,
for the great Mother seems calling her
children to rest, as she raises the veil from her
inmost shrine and discloses her altar of peace. The
presence of the smoking volcano which dominates the
landscape, supplies that poignant note which, like a
minor chord, accentuates the sweetness of the
melody. "Gather ye roses while ye may," sounds
Nature's admonition to humanity amid the lavish
loveliness of blossom and foliage, clothing the
mysterious height which hides the smouldering
fountains of eternal fire beneath the vivid splendours
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>of tropical vegetation. The population of Ternate&mdash;native,
Malay, Dutch, and half-caste&mdash;throngs the
wharf; the pretty schoolmistress, in spotless muslin,
waves a smiling farewell. Though we are to each
other but as "ships that pass in the night," the
memory of cheery words and gracious deeds throws
rays of light across the surging seas, and the
golden cord of kindness anchors heart to heart.
Passengers are few from these remote parts. A
Dutch officer, with a half-caste wife and two unruly
children, whose violent outbreaks would even give
points to the juvenile English of British India, are
returning from a three years' exile at Ternate. The
incompetence of Malay nurses is equalled by the
maternal indifference to kicking and squealing,
which threatens pandemonium for the remainder of
the voyage. At the last moment the native Sultan
of Batjan embarks for his island home, after commercial
negotiations in Ternate, for this native
prince, a keen-faced man in European dress and
scarlet turban, trades largely in <i>damar</i>, the basis of
his wealth. When at anchor next morning in the
wooded bay of Batjan, the green State Barge of his
Highness, with drums beating and banners flying,
flashes through the water, the blades of the large
green oars shaped like lotus-leaves. A horse's head
carved at the prow, and a line of floating pennants&mdash;red,
black, and white&mdash;above the gilded roof of the
deck-house, enhance the barbaric effect of the gaudy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>boat, the brown rowers clad in white, with gay
scarves and turbans.</p>

<p>Although our ship possesses a launch, various
modes of landing are required by the vagaries
of the tide, the outlying reefs, and the position
of the ports. A wobbling erection of crossed
oars, a plank insecurely poised on the shoulders of
two men, a rocking <i>bloto</i>, and an occasional wade to
shore, with shoes and stockings in hand, vary the
monotony of the proceedings. Landing at Batjan is
accomplished in a chair, borne aloft on two woolly
black heads, but the shore, being cut off by a crowd
of fishing craft, can only be reached by sundry
scrambles over intermediate boats. The Sultan's
modest mansion stands in the midst of the palm-thatched
<i>campong</i>, ostensibly guarded by a grey fort,
among rustling bamboos and tall sugar-canes. A
friendly native offers me a palm-leaf basket, filled
with nutmeg sprays of glossy leaves and yellow fruit
from a roadside plantation, and a tribe of children,
dancing along through the delicious shade of a palm-grove,
leads the way to a point of view on a green
knoll, with merry laughter and eager gesticulation.
Blue mountain crests soar above dark realms of
virgin forest, where the sombre conifers exude the
precious <i>damar</i>, which glues itself to the red trunks
in shining lumps often of twenty pounds' weight,
or sinks deeply into the soft soil, from whence the
solidified gum needs excavation. The <i>damar</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>pounded and poured into palm-leaf tubes, serves for
the torches of the fishermen, and for the lighting of
the dusky native houses. Batjan&mdash;rich in gold,
copper, and coal&mdash;awaits full development of the
mineral treasures hidden in the mountains of the
interior. The island was colonised in early days by
a band of wandering Malays, who exchanged the
perils of the sea for the tropical abundance of this
unknown anchorage, sheltered within the reefs of
the lagoon-like bay. If an aboriginal element
existed in Batjan, it probably died out or mingled
with the immigrant race, which broke off from the
main body of the nomadic Malays, and formed one
of the numerous sub-divisions of the stock eventually
planted on almost every island and continent of the
vast Pacific. The weaving of a bark cloth, stained
with the red juice of water-plants, suggests an
industry of these early days. The native cuisine
still includes the unfamiliar Malay delicacy of
flying fox cooked in spice, and the hereditary skill
in hunting finds endless satisfaction in forests
abounding with deer, wild pig, and edible birds. A
touch of barbarism lends a charm to mysterious
Batjan, and the marked individuality which belongs
to every portion of the Molucca group is nowhere
more apparent than in this island, which lies on the
borderland of civilisation without losing the distinctive
character stamped upon it by the influences of
an immemorial past.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>Crescent-shaped Boeroe, where difficulties in
landing involve launch, <i>bloto</i>, and paddling through
a long reach of shallow water to a black swamp,
possesses a commercial rather than an artistic value,
being the only place in the Archipelago which
exports eucalyptus oil, locally known as <i>kajopoetah</i>.
A fleet of <i>praus</i>, with graceful masts
of bending bamboo, surrounds the steamer, the
aromatic cargo packed in long bamboo cases. The
head-man of the <i>campong</i>, lightly attired in his
native brown, with a few touches of contrasting
colour in scarf and turban, acts as escort through a
maze of weedy paths, and across bamboo bridges in
various stages of dilapidation to a couple of dreary
villages. The religious interests of Boeroe are
represented by two ruinous <i>Messighits</i>, and a deplorable
Dutch conventicle. Some Hindu element
underlies native idiosyncracy, for nearly every
forehead bears a white prayer-mark, but the
unchanging conservatism of localities almost untouched
by the lapse of Time, often retains symbolic
forms when their original meaning is entirely
forgotten, and the lack of missionary or educational
enterprise among the Dutch exercises a paralysing
effect on the small communities of distant islands.
Only a relative poverty belongs to a clime where the
shaking of a sago-palm provides a large family with
rations for three months, but the physical energies
of Boeroe have ebbed to a point where "desire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>fails," and the unsatisfactory conditions of life meet
for the most part with apathetic acceptance. The
marshy coast abounds with harmless snakes, but
these gruesome inmates of the tropical morass
seldom leave their hiding-places before sunset. The
presence of the steamer awakens a faint simulacrum
of life and interest in sleepy Boeroe, and a native
woman, in the rusty black calico wherewith Dutch
Calvinism counteracts the Eastern love of glowing
colours, brings a rickety chair from her dingy hut,
and sets the precious possession under a shadowy
nutmeg-tree in the village street. A little crowd
assembles, for local excitements are few, and the
Malay phrase-book, an inseparable companion, aids
in carrying on a halting conversation, eked out with
signs and facial contortions. No school is found on
Boeroe, and the simple people assert with submissive
sadness that nothing is done for them. The
tone of regret suggests an underlying consciousness
of the hopeless ignorance inevitable under the conditions
of their narrow lot. The watery plain,
covered with tangled verdure, extends to the foot of
the twin peaks which merge into a low range of
wooded hills, their lower slopes glistening with the
grey-green foliage of the great <i>kajopoetah</i> trees.
The writhing roots of screw-palms rise above the
green marshes, and patches of tobacco alternate
with ripening millet, but every crop seems allowed
to degenerate into unpruned disorder, and the feeble
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>attempts at cultivation soon lapse into the surrounding
wilderness. The ruddy trunk of the candelabra-tree
towers above the ferns and oil-palms of the tall
undergrowth, the glossy sword-like leaves, often ten
feet long, being woven into the <i>cocoyas</i>, or
sleeping mats, peculiar to Boeroe. The whistle of
the steamer proves a welcome summons from this
melancholy island, a solitary exception to the divine
beauty and irresistible witchery of the Molucca
group.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<h3>AMBON.</h3>


<p>The fiord-like Bay of Ambon flows into the heart of
the fragrant Clove Island, between the peninsulas of
Heitor and L&eacute;itemor, which gradually ascend from
the harbour's mouth until their heights of glowing
green merge into wooded mountains, behind the
white town of Amboyna. This old European
settlement ranks as the tiny capital of the Molucca
group. <i>Praus</i> and fishing smacks dot the blue
inlet with tawny sails and curving masts, the local
craft varied by a fantastic barque from the barbarous
K&eacute; isles, with pointed yellow beak and plume of
crimson feathers at the prow, suggesting some
tropical bird afloat upon the tide. The glossy
darkness of the clove plantations enhances the paler
tints of the prevailing foliage, and the virginal tints
of the sylvan scenery indicate a climate of perpetual
spring. Thatched roofs, and walls of plaited palm-leaf,
stand among white-washed cottages of coral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>concrete, for low houses, or slight material, afford
comparative security against collapse by earthquake.
The brown population throngs the pier, and a little
fleet of <i>dug-outs</i> escorts the steamer through the
bay with gay songs and merry laughter, for the
lively Ambonese value every link that binds them
to the outside world, and this is their gala day.
Bold, eager, craving for foreign intercourse, and
possessing the quickened intelligence due to the
mixture of Dutch and Portuguese blood with the
native strain, a roving spirit of adventure counteracts
the lazy independence of a life where daily
needs are supplied without exertion. The sea
swarms with fish, the woods teem with sago, and
cultivation of the clove procures extra wages when
any special purpose requires them. The Portuguese
who colonised Ambon, in the zenith of their
maritime power, were of vigorous stock, and the
mental heritage of the island was permanently
enriched by elements derived from a foreign source.</p>

<p>The Ambonese soldiers of the Netherlands India
manifest a courageous and warlike character; their
rate of payment equals that of their European
brothers-in-arms, and in the raids or skirmishes
frequent throughout the wild districts of Celebes and
Sumatra they play a spirited part. The burghers of
Ambon show more of the Dutch element in their
composition. The island, Christianised in the dreary
mode of Calvinistic Holland, accepts in half-hearted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>fashion the creed so incongruous with tropical
Nature. Dutch missionaries, waging aimless war
against brightness and colour, arrayed their brown
converts in funereal gloom. The Sunday attire of
the men consists of black calico coats down to the
heels, and flopping black trousers. The women
wear a shapeless gown of the same shabby and shiny
material, with a white scarf dangling from the left
arm. These blots on the brilliancy of the scene
produce a curious impression when approaching the
wharf, where the native bronze of children and
coolies, the blue robes of Chinamen, and the gay
turbans of Mohammedans, blend harmoniously with
the scheme of colour in flower and foliage. The
<i>praus</i> which follow in our wake make ready the
rustic Malay anchor, a forked branch of stout
timber, strengthened by twisted rattan, which also
secures the stone cross-piece. This relic of a
distant past can scarcely have changed since the
days when the wandering tribe first launched upon
the blue waters of the Pacific, in that mysterious
voyage which moulded the destinies of the Malay
race. A rudimental feeling for art co-exists with
imperfect civilisation, and elaborate carving adorns
rude skiffs, floats of fishing lines, and even wooden
beaters of the clay used in native pottery. A
dervish, in turban of flaming orange and garb
of green and white, beats a huge drum in
the pillared court of a large mosque, for the followers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>of the Prophet are numerous, and though the usual
deadly conventicle occupies a conspicuous place, it
produces no effect on the Arab element. The son of
the Dutch pastor who, after his grim fashion,
Christianised the former generation, proves better
than his condemnatory creed, and acts as personal
conductor to the sights of Amboyna. After a rest in
the flower-wreathed verandah of his home, and a
chat with his kindly half-caste wife, we visit
the gilded and dragon-carved mansion of a
leading Chinese merchant, friendly, hospitable, and
delighted to exhibit his household gods, both in
literal and figurative form. A visit to the Joss
Temple follows, liberally supported by this smiling
Celestial, whose zeal and charity may perchance
plead for him in that purer sanctuary not made with
hands, and as yet unrevealed to his spiritual sight.
The appalling green and vermilion deities who
guard the temple courts, indicate fear as the chosen
handmaid of faith in this grotesque travesty of
religion, but the costly tiling of violet and azure,
the rich gilding of the curling eaves terminating
in scarlet dragons, and the deeply-chiselled ebony,
falling like a veil of thick black lace before the jade
and porphyry shrines, prove that even the despised
Chinaman offers of his best to the Divinity dimly
apprehended by his darkened soul.</p>

<p>The large Malay School of Amboyna manifests
an educational position in advance of the smaller
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>islands, and knowledge of the wider world beyond
the Archipelago stimulates the spirit of enterprise
inherited in different degrees and varying conditions,
both from Malay and Portuguese ancestry.</p>

<p>A dilapidated carriage is chartered with difficulty,
as only three vehicles belong to the island, and the
driver evidently expects his skeleton steed to collapse
at any pace quicker than a walk. The green lanes,
with their hedges of scarlet hybiscus overhung by
the feathery foliage of tamarind and bamboo, wind
along the shore, and penetrate into the depths of
the hills. Rustling sago-palms sway their tall
plumes on the mountain side, and shadow luxuriant
clove gardens, their pungent aroma mingling with
nutmeg and cinnamon to steep the soft sea-wind
in a wealth of perfume. European houses of white
stone nestle among palm and tamarind, the broad
seats flanking the central door, and the bulging balconies
of old Dutch style recalling the 16th century
dwellings on the canal banks of distant Holland,
but the crow-stepped gable here gives place to the
flat roof. Every green garden contains a refuge of
interwoven <i>gaba-gaba</i> stalks, as a retreat during
earthquakes, when the overthrow of the flimsy
arbour would entail no injury, though it serves as a
shelter from the torrential rains which often accompany
volcanic disturbances. A wayside stall of
palm-thatched bamboo provides <i>sageroe</i> for thirsty
pilgrims. This fermented beverage often excites
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>the Ambonese nature to frenzy, though only made
from the juice of the <i>ar&ecirc;n</i> or sugar palm. The
brown dame who presides over the bamboo buckets,
in her eagerness to honour a white customer, wipes
an incredibly dirty tumbler on her gruesome calico
skirt before dipping the precious glass into the
foaming pail, and tastes the draught by way of
encouragement. With some difficulty she is induced
to wash the tumbler, and to omit the last reassuring
ceremony. The <i>sageroe</i>, sweet and refreshing,
gains tonic properties from an infusion of quassia,
which sharpens the flavour and strengthens the
compound, packed in bamboo cases or plaited palm-leaf
bags for transport to the neighbouring islands.
A grey fort, and weather-worn Government
offices, flank the green <i>aloon-aloon</i> of Amboyna,
surrounded by tamarind avenues. The Dutch
Resident finds ample employment, owing to the
mania for litigation among the Ambonese. The
honour of appearing before a Court of Justice is
eagerly sought, and imaginary claims or grievances
are constantly invented in order to satisfy the
ambition for publicity. A modest and retiring
temperament forms no part of native equipment,
and the slight veneer of Christianity, in the crudest
phase of Dutch Protestantism, increases the
aggressive tendency. The missionary agencies of
Calvinistic Holland seem incapable of practical
sympathy with the island people; but half a loaf is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>better than no bread, and in any form of Christian
faith the Heavenly Husbandman scatters grains of
wheat among the tares, that all His wandering
children may reap a share of harvest gold even from
a stubborn and sterile soil.</p>

<p>Amboyna shows signs of commercial prosperity
in the crowded <i>passer</i> and the busy Chinese
<i>campong</i>, for the enterprising Celestial forms an
important element of the mercantile community in
the Clove Island. Three memorial tablets erected
in front of the hoary fort, the bare Dutch church,
and the crumbling guard-house, record the worthy
name of Padrugge, a Dutch Governor who restored
Amboyna after complete destruction by a violent
earthquake, that ever-haunting terror within the
great volcanic chain of the Malay Archipelago.
The steep acclivity behind the palm-shaded park of
the Residency contains a stalactite grotto, infested
by a multitude of bats, which cling to the sparkling
pendants of the fretted roof, unless disturbed by the
Ambonese coolies, who regard them as culinary
delicacies, and catch them in this ancient breeding-place,
with a noise which brings down the terrified
creatures into unwelcome proximity, cutting short
any attempts at exploration, and causing rash
intruders to beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>In the hush of dawn, when the intensity
of calm steals colour as well as sound from
the motionless waters, we embark on an expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to the <i>Zeetuinen</i>, or Sea Gardens, the fairy
world of the coral reefs, revealed through the
magic mirror of the watery depths. As we
gaze steadily through the silvery blue of the
glassy sea, a misty vision of vague outline and
shifting colour materialises into an enchanted
forest, and appears rising towards the surface.
Coral trees, pink and white, gold and green, orange
and red, wave interlacing branches of lace-like
texture and varying form, above the blue water-ways
which divide the tremulous masses of rainbow-tinted
foliage. The sinuous channels expand at
intervals into quiet pools, bordered with azure and
purple sea-stars, or studded with clumps of yellow
lilies, spotted and striped with carmine. A circle
of rock, enclosing a miniature lake, blazes with rose
and scarlet anemones, and the boat, floating over the
wilderness of marine vegetation, pauses above a coral
growth, varied in form as any tropical woodland.
Majestic trees, of amber and emerald hue, stand
with roots muffled in fading fern, or sunk in
perforated carpets of white sponge, and huge
vegetable growths or giant weeds, lustrous with
metallic tints of green and violet, fill clefts and
ravines of coral rock. A grove of sea-palms mimics
the features of the upper world, as though Nature
obeyed some mysterious law of form, lying behind
her operations, to regulate expression and bring
order out of chaos. Giant bunches of black and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>mauve grapes, like the pictured spoils of the
Promised Land, lie on soft beds of feathery moss,
but the familiar greens of the velvety carpet shade
into orange and pink. A weird marine plant shoves
long black stems, crowned with a circle of azure
blue eyes, which convey an uncanny sensation of
being regarded with sleepless vigilance by mysterious
sentinels, transformed and spellbound in ocean
depths. Tree-fern and hart's-tongue show verdant
fronds, flushed with autumnal red or gold, and a
dense growth of starry flowers suggests a bed of
many-coloured tulips. Dazzling fish dart through
the crystal depths. A shoal of scarlet and green
parrot-fish pursue a tribe striped with blue and
orange. Gold-fish flash like meteors between uplifted
spears of blood-red coral, and the glittering
scales of myriads, splashed with ruby, or flecked
with amethyst, reflect the colours of the gorgeously-frilled
and rosetted anemones in parterres between
red coral crags. Tresses of filmy green floating
from the mouth of a cavern, suggest a mermaid's
hair, and her visible presence would scarcely add to
the wonders in this under-world of glamour and
mystery. Shells, pink and pearly, brown and lilac,
scarlet and cobalt, strew the flower-decked floor with
infinite variety, concave and spiral, ribbed and
fluted, fretted and jagged&mdash;the satin smoothness of
convoluted forms lying amid rugged shapes bristling
with spines and needles. We gaze almost with awe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>at the lovely vision of a dainty Nautilus, sailing his
fairy boat down a blue channel fringed with purple
and salmon-coloured anemones, beneath a hedge of
rosy coral. The shimmering sail and carven hull
of iridescent pearl skim the water with incredible
swiftness, and tack skilfully at every bend of the
devious course, not even slackening speed to avoid
collision with a lumbering star-fish encountered on
the way. These submarine Gardens contain the
greatest natural collection of anemones, coral
beds, shells, and fish, discovered in the ocean
world. The richest treasures of Davy Jones's
Locker lie open to view, as the boat glides through
the ever-changing scenery mirrored in the transparent
sea. Opalescent berries resemble heaps of
pearls, and the lemon stalks of marine sedge gleam
like wedges of gold in the crystalline depths. The
long oars detach pinnacles of coral like tongues of
flame, and a cargo of seaweed, shells, and anemones,
fills the boat as each enchanted grotto contributes a
quota of treasure trove, but the vivid colouring fades
apace when the sea-born flora leaves the native
element, and the deep blue eyes, gazing from their
dark stems with weird human effect, lose their
radiance in the upper world.</p>

<p>We land at the pretty valley of Halong, where a
rippling brook traverses a wood of sago-palms, and
falls in a white cascade over the rocks of a sheltered
bathing-pool, screened by green curtains of banana
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>and tall mangosteens, laden with purple fruit.
Makassar-trees rain their yellow blossoms into the
water, cloves fill the air with pungent fragrance,
and lychees droop over the clear current. A melancholy
Malay song floats up from the sea, but the sad
sweet notes only accentuate the haunted silence of
the fairy glen, with an echo from that distant
past which breathes undying music round these
enchanted isles. Woodland shadows and wayside
palms disclose the sweeping horse-shoe curves
of numerous Chinese tombs, the white stone
elaborately carved and covered with hieroglyphics.
Plumy cocoanut and tremulous tamarind wave over
the last resting-places of these exiles from the Holy
Land of the Celestial Empire, for the second
generation established on an alien soil is forbidden
to seek burial in China. The so-called <i>Paranak</i>
of the Malay Archipelago frequently marries a native
wife, and, as purity of race becomes destroyed,
ancestral obligations lose their power even over the
mind of the most conservative people in the world.</p>

<p>The woods of Ambon teem with the abundant
bird-life peculiar to the Moluccas. An exquisite
kingfisher, with golden plumage and emerald throat,
darts across the stream, and the scarlet crests of
green parrots resemble tropical flowers, glowing
amidst the verdant foliage hardly distinguishable
from the fluttering wings of the feathered tribe,
which includes twenty-two species indigenous to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>islands. The megapodius or mound-maker, an ash-coloured
bird about the size of a small fowl, grasps
sand or soil in the hollow of a powerful claw, and
throws it backwards into mounds six feet high,
wherein the eggs are deposited, to be hatched by this
natural incubator, through the heat of the vegetable
matter contained in the rubbish heap. The young
birds work their way through the mound, and run
off at once into the forest, where they start on an
independent career. They emerge from their birthplace
covered with thick down and provided with
fully-developed wings. The maternal instinct of
the megapodius ceases with the laying of eggs, and,
having supplied a safe cradle for the rising
generation, she takes no further thought for her
precocious progeny, capable of securing a livelihood
in the unknown world from the moment of their
first appearance in public.</p>

<p>A merry group, half-hidden in the shadows
of clustering sago-palms, gathers the harvest of
precious grain, the pith of a large tree producing
thirty bundles, each of thirty pounds
weight. The baking of the sago-cakes made
from this lavish store occupies two women for five
days, and the housekeeping cares of the largest
family only need quarterly consideration in this
island of plenty, where the struggle for the necessaries
of existence is unknown and unimaginable.
Leisure and liberty, those priceless gifts which can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>only be attained where the pressure of poverty is
unfelt, serve valuable purposes in Ambonese hands,
for the European energies fused into the native race
prevent mental stagnation, and spur tropical
indolence to manifold activities. A variety of
thriving industries belong to this far-off colony.
Mother-of-pearl shells, and <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> (the sea-slug
of Chinese cuisine) supplement the important
export of the cloves, the speciality of Ambon, chosen
by the East India Company as the sole place of
cultivation for this spice-bearing tree, when the
system of monopoly extirpated the clove gardens of
the other islands. Vases, mats, and miniature
boats, of fringed and threaded cloves, are offered as
fantastic souvenirs of Amboyna, and the spirit of the
place seems imprisoned in these tiny curios which
revive so many haunting memories of the romantic
island.</p>

<p>Nominal adherence to Dutch Calvinism fails to
repress the natural instincts of a gay and pleasure-loving
race. The national dance known as <i>Menari</i>,
and often performed on the shore in honour of the
outgoing steamer, no longer satisfies Ambonese
requirements, with the slow gyrations and studied
postures of Oriental tradition. The eager and
passionate temperament finds truer expression in
the walzes and galops of European origin, known
as <i>dansi-dansi</i>, enthusiastically practised on those
festive occasions, when the full dress of funereal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>black and white seems specially inappropriate to
the wild abandon of the merry-making populace.
In sunny Amboyna the cowl does not make
the friar, and the last recollection of the little
Moluccan capital is a vision of whirling figures and
twanging lutes at the water's edge, while the
receding steamer furrows the milky azure of the
land-locked bay. The vivid green of one palm-clad
shore burns in the gold of sunset, but the eastern
side lies veiled in shadow, and as the sheltered inlet
gives place to the open sea, the luminous phosphorescence
of the Southern ocean bathes the rocky
bastions of enchanted Ambon in waves of liquid fire.
A strange history belongs to the physical conformation
of volcanic shores, alternately raised and
depressed by the agitation of earth and sea. The
coast-line has varied from time to time; straits have
become lakes, islands have severed or united,
occasionally rising suddenly from the waves, or
vanishing in the bosom of the deep. Geologists
assert that the Malay Archipelago was originally
thrown off by volcanic action from Asia and
Australia, and that an interchange of animal and
vegetable life has frequently taken place. Hurricanes
have uprooted forest trees, and floods have
borne them out to sea, the tide eventually washing
them up on the shores of distant islands. A fresh
growth of foreign vegetation was thus inaugurated,
as these sylvan colonists struck their saplings into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>an alien soil. Insects, preserved by the bark,
propagated themselves in new surroundings, and
seeds drifting on the waves, or clinging to roots and
fibres, wreathed unfamiliar shores with exotic
flowers. Animal migration has frequently been
caused by natural catastrophes, and to birds
directing their swift flight by faculties now
attributed to keen observation rather than to
unreasoning instinct, the change of locality was
infinitely simplified. In the Moluccas we may read
a compendium of the wide-spread history which
applies to the vast regions comprised in the mighty
Archipelago. The doctrine of earthly changes and
chances, too often accepted as a mere figure of
speech, is here recognised as a stern reality; the
tragedies of destruction repeat themselves through
the ages, the laboratories of Nature eternally forge
fresh thunderbolts, and the fate of humanity
trembles in the balance. Meanwhile a profusion of
flowers wreathes the sacrificial altars, the fairest
fruits ripen above the thin veil which hides the
fountains of volcanic fire, and the sweetest spices
of the world breathe incense on the air. The
uncertain tenure of earthly joys gives them
redoubled zest and poignancy, the passionate love of
life becomes intensified by the looming shadows of
Death, and the light glows with clearer radiance
against the blackness of the menacing thunder-cloud.</p>

<h3>BANDA.</h3>


<p>The exquisite islands of Banda, dominated by the
stately volcano of Goenoeng Api (the mountain of
fire), form the climax of the enchanting Moluccas.
Contour and colour reach their utmost grace and
softest refinement in this ideal spot, a priceless jewel
resting on the heart of the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p>The mists of dawn have scarcely lifted their
gossamer veils from the dreaming sea, when the
pinnacled rocks of Rum and Aye, the outposts of the
Banda group, pierce the swathing vapours. The
creamy cliffs of Swangi (the Ghost Island), traditionally
haunted by the spirits of the departed, show
their spectral outlines on the northern horizon, and
the sun-flushed "wings of the morning" span the
sapphire arch of heaven as we enter the sheltered
gulf of the Zonnegat, fringed by luxuriant woods
clothing a mountain side, and brushing the water
with a green fringe of trailing branches. Gliding
between Cape Lantaka and two isolated crags, the
steamer enters a glassy lake, encircled by sylvan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>heights, with the menacing cone of the Goenoeng
Api rising sheer from the water's edge. A white
town climbs in irregular tiers up the shelving
terraces of a fairy island, the central hill crowned
by the crenellated battlements of a grey citadel.
The largest ship can anchor close to shore, for the
rugged boundaries of Banda descend by steep
gradients into the crystalline depths. Chinese and
Arab <i>campongs</i> border European streets of concrete
houses, long and low, with flat roofs and external
galleries.</p>

<p>The southern shore of Banda Neira faces the
forest-clad heights of Great Banda, clothed from
base to summit with nutmeg trees, shadowed by
huge kanaris, their interlacing canopies protecting
the precious spice plantations from the sun. A
slender rowing boat, known as a <i>belang</i>, makes a
brilliant point of colour on the blue strait between
the sister islands. Red and yellow flags and
pennants flutter above the green deck; the clash of
gongs and cymbals echoes across the water, and a
weird chant accompanies the rhythmic plash of
the short oars, as the brown rowers toss them high
in air, and bring them down with a sharp splash.
A splendid avenue of kanari-trees extends along the
shore, the usual Dutch church symbolises the
uncompromising grimness of Calvinistic creed, and
the crumbling fort of Orange-Nassau, the scene of
many stirring incidents in the island past, adjoins
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>the beautiful thatched bungalow of the Resident,
the broad eaves emerging from depths of richest
foliage. A subterranean passage connects the
deserted stronghold on the shore with Fort Belgica,
the citadel now used as barracks, but formerly for
the preservation of the nutmegs from the fierce
raids of foreign powers, when the new-born passion
for spices intoxicated the mind of the world, and
kindled the fires of war between East and West.
The lofty peak of the Goenoeng Api still smoulders,
although the main crater is supposed to be
extinct. The lower slopes, where not planted with
vegetables by enterprising invaders from the island
of Boeton, abound with delicate ferns and rare
orchids, for the fertility of the volcanic soil, rich in
metallic ingredients, creates a luxuriant growth.
Sulphureous vapours rise continually from a plateau
beneath the summit, where tumbled boulders of
blackened lava lie sunken in deep layers of volcanic
ash. Banda Neira evidently rose from the sea in
some long-past eruption of the larger island, now
the long ridge of a ruined crater which collapsed
in a fierce outburst, and threw off the fragments of
rock which compose the outer group. A curious
fatalism characterises the inhabitants of volcanic
districts, and the incalculable value of Banda in
the middle ages outweighed all risks of eruption and
earthquake. The history of island colonisation by
Portugal, Spain, and Holland, forms a continuous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>record of battle, loot, and persecution, in which the
native population was decimated, and even now the
inhabitants would be quite insufficient to cultivate
and gather the "golden fruit," without the aid of
innumerable emigrants from Java. Hard measures
were dealt out in order to maintain the monopoly of
spices, and the injury to the native races, by
destroying the nutmeg trees of the other islands,
crippled the trade which had found a natural outlet
in Asia. All the nutmegs were sent to Europe, but
one-fifth of the yearly produce was diverted by
smuggling into forbidden channels, though severe
punishment was inflicted upon offenders. Economic
administration was unknown in the 17th and 18th
centuries, but the holocaust of spices burnt in the
market-place of Amsterdam, and the extermination
of the nutmeg trees in Moluccan islands, sent a
thrill of horror through the European world, which
placed such an exaggerated value on the possession
of spices that the wars waged to secure them breathe
the romantic fanaticism of a wild crusade. Monopoly
and slavery were at length definitely abolished,
and in 1873 the Dutch Government, realising the
necessity of Free Trade, sanctioned the independence
of the nutmeg planters. The far-seeing views
of Sir Stamford Raffles during the second brief
English occupation of the Moluccas, from 1810 to
1816, were disregarded in England (knowing little,
and caring less, about the remote Spice Islands),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>though his counsels were eventually adopted by the
Dutch Government as the only means of ensuring
an increased profit. A high-prowed native boat,
known as an <i>orembai</i>, plies across the narrow
strait which separates the islands of Banda Neira
and Banda Lonthar, or Great Banda. The long
range of hills covered with a dense forest of the
precious nutmeg trees, attains an ideal of sylvan
scenery surpassing even the glorious palm-woods of
Java. These may be described in terms of comparative
accuracy, and their beauty painted in
realistic language, but none can translate into words
the irresistible charm and glamour of the nutmeg
aisles, the exquisite foliage and contours of the spice-bearing
trees, the wealth of delicate blossom and
peach-like fruit, and the flickering emerald light
from hues shading through the whole gamut of
colour, from the tender verdure of spring to the
glossy darkness of winter evergreen. Colossal
kanari-trees, veritable monarchs of the forest, tower
over the nutmegs, and form an unbroken roof of
interlacing boughs, for the nutmeg, needing shelter
to bring the fruit to perfection, is not suffered to
attain a height of more than seventy feet. The
columnar trunks of the majestic kanaris wreathe
their huge girth with lace-like fern and broad-leaved
epiphytal plants, and the symmetrical beauty of the
conical nutmeg-trees in these forest aisles suggests
a vast sanctuary of Nature, enshrining the mystic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>presence of Divinity. Here, as amid the shades of
unfallen Eden, we can imagine a trysting-place of
God and man in the perennial "cool of the day,"
which breathes through the green twilight of these
solemn groves, redolent with the incense from
myriad sprays of creamy blossom and ripened nuts
in shells of pink-flushed amber, for flower and fruit
deck the "gold-bearing tree" without intermission,
and every day produces a fresh harvest of nutmegs.
The brown kernel of the opening fruit, contained in
a network of scarlet mace, falls to the ground in
twenty-four hours, and unremitting care is needed in
gathering and handling the nutmegs with the
<i>gaai-gaai</i>, a long stick ending with a prong, to
break off the ripe fruit into the woven basket
accurately poised beneath the wooden fork. Only
the female trees yield the precious crop, and the
highest point of production, attained at the twentieth
year, continues undiminished through four subsequent
decades, after which the strength of the
average tree declines, although it often lives for a
century. The cooing of the nutmeg pigeon, which
feeds on the abundant fruit, echoes through the
shadowy glades with soothing monotony. Yellow
canaries flit through the vivid green of the pointed
foliage, and the scarlet crests of parrots glow
through the dark canopies of the giant kanari-trees.
The voices of children at play, the distant songs of
the nutmeg-gatherers, the plash of the waves on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>coral reef, and the scented breeze whispering in the
green crowns of a million trees, blend in harmonious
concord to fill the sylvan temple of tropical Nature
with mysterious music. At wide intervals the white
houses of the planters gleam amid the drooping
boughs, the prevailing green of the spacious woods
relieved by the rosy purple of Bougainvillea mantling
a pillared verandah, or by great vases of crimson and
yellow flowers, bordering broad flights of stone steps.
Life on a great nutmeg plantation retains patriarchal
character and archaic charm; the multitude of
dependents calls forth, in the present day at any
rate, much of kindly solicitude, and though the
unvarying sameness of existence sometimes proves
the serpent which destroys the peace of the idyllic
Eden in young and eager hearts, the ramifications
of the large family party, gathered under one roof,
mitigate the monotony of daily tasks, and supply the
necessary mental friction. Work in the nutmeg-woods
begin at 5 a.m., when a pealing bell summons
the labourers to each plantation for their different
duties of gathering the nuts, drying the mace, or
sorting and liming the fruit. The beautiful forest
constitutes the world of the nutmeg-gatherer, both
for labour and recreation. In these dusky avenues
youth and maiden tell each other Love's eternal
story, wandering away into the dreamland shadows,
vocal with sweeter melody than that of bird or
breeze. The musical call of the nutmeg-pigeon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
serves as a danger-signal, uttered by sympathising
friends, when love must yield to life's stern realities
in the person of the overseer. An ardent courtship
often contributes to the rapid filling of the nutmeg-basket
in the hand of a rustic beauty, whose admirers
strive to secure for her the premium awarded for
special diligence, and a judicious official learns on
occasion to be conveniently deaf to the feigned voice
of the <i>manoek faloer</i>. If the chivalrous zeal of
the brown lover is apt to overleap frontiers, and to
fill the baskets of one plantation with the produce of
the other, the ethics of Banda demonstrate the
identity of human nature when swayed by the
passion which, according to circumstances, wrecks
Troy or raids a nutmeg orchard. A story is told of
a planter who, in consequence of engaging a bevy of
attractive maidens for the year's work, was rewarded
by a phenomenal harvest of nutmegs, though the
adjacent estates were barren of fruit. Evening
shadows darken apace in the woodland world, and
work ceases at three in the afternoon, when the
store of gathered fruit is brought to the <i>pagger</i>,
where drying and liming sheds surround the central
warehouse. The nutmeg-pickers sort the ripe nuts
in an open gallery before taking them to the
drying-shed, where they are spread on a platform
of split bamboo, twelve feet above a smouldering fire.
The process continues for six weeks, the nuts being
repeatedly turned until they begin to rattle. Only a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>slow method of drying prevents the escape of the
essential oil, necessary to the flavour of the fruit,
which must afterwards be dipped in slaked lime to
preserve it from insects. The coral-like mace
contains a rich supply of aromatic balm, and when
loosened from the nutmeg can be dried in the sun.
The delicate scarlet branches, spread on wickerwork
frames in open spaces of the woods, contrast vividly
with the shaded verdure of the beautiful trees. The
mace, trodden flat for facility in packing, resembles
a dainty growth of finest seaweed, and in the 16th
century shared popularity with the nutmeg which
produced it. Even in the present day a pewter
spice box is an indispensable present on that sixth
anniversary of a Dutch marriage still known as
"the pewter wedding," and a nutmeg-box, with a
grater, remains as a favourite bridal gift, the fashion
originating when the passion for spices first pervaded
medi&aelig;val Europe. Trade, as well as Science,
wrote many chapters of romantic adventure in the
long history of the world's social development, and
modern thought but dimly realises the magnetic
spell of the days when the veil was first lifted
between East and West, and the wonders of
untrodden shores disclosed to the pioneer. Heine,
in his <i>Lieder</i>, chants of the mystic nutmeg-tree as
the ideal growth of the tropical forest, for every
stage of life and growth reveals some fresh beauty
in delicate bloom, glistening foliage, and fruit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>roseate gold. The spreading boughs, with their
perfect contour and emerald depths of light and
shadow, suggest a typical picture of that unfading
Tree of Life in the midst of the earthly Paradise,
round which the passing ages weave innumerable
dreams, while faith transplants it to a fairer Garden
than that of Eden. Where the winding woodland
roads lead along the shore, colossal screw-palms
and silver-flowered Barringtonias border the rocks,
the sparkling azure of the sea visible through the
fantastic boughs, and the eternal song of the surf
vibrating through the still air with mysterious
undertones. The brown <i>campong</i> of Banda Lonthar
stands at the foot of the mossy steps which lead to
the summit of the wooded range, and command a
superb view of the island group. A further flight of
stairs descends to the outside coast or Achterval, but
wherever we go, to quote the words of a modern
traveller, "we may imagine ourselves transported
to the holy groves whereof ancient poets sing."
From the rich carpet of velvety moss and plumy fern
to the green vault of the leafy roof, the eye for once
seems "satisfied with seeing," for no hint of
imperfection breaks the fairy spell of enchantment
in this poetic nutmeg-forest. Among serpentine
kanari roots, which stream across the mossy turf as
though poured out in liquid form and then petrified,
we come across brown babies sleeping in the shade,
and cradled softly in the tender lap of earth, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>the mother, crooning a low song, pursues her work
among the rustling leaves. Terrace after terrace,
the green aisles mount to the summit of the great
ridge, and the ruined forts on each wooded promontory
recall the long-past days when the "fruit of
gold" demanded the increasing vigilance of military
power to defeat the onslaught of merchantman or
privateer, willing to run every risk in order to
capture a cargo of spices, and secure fabulous gains
by appeasing the frantic thirst of Europe for the
novel luxury of the aromatic spoils. The medi&aelig;val
craze has died away, and the pungent spices of the
Orient have taken a permanent position of reasonable
proportion in the culinary art of modern times,
but the glamour of the past, like the amber haze of
a tropical sunset, still environs the poetic tree in the
island home where, amid evergreen foliage and
waxen flowers, the famous "fruit of gold" still
opens each coral-lined censer to exhale a wealth of
undying fragrance on the balmy air.</p>

<h3>THE SOELA-BESSIR ISLES.</h3>


<p>Outside the fairy circle of the exquisite Moluccas, a
tiny cluster of palm-clad islets gems the wide blue
spaces of the lonely sea, unbroken for many leagues
by any foothold possible for human habitation. The
Dutch steamer only calls thrice a year at the remote
Soela-Bessir group, in quest of rattan, a plentiful
product of these fertile isles, where the leafy ladders
of the aspiring parasite climb to the green crowns of
the tallest palms, wrapping them in the fatal
embrace which eventually levels the strongest
monarch of the tropical forest to the earth. The
thick mantle of glossy foliage often hides the multitude
of hooks, loops, and nooses which the pliant
cane flings round branch and stem, gripped by long
ropes of flexible fibre, hardening into thick coils,
rigid and unyielding as iron. The immense export
of rattan for chairs, couches, and innumerable
domestic purposes, indirectly results in the preservation
of myriad palm-trees, by releasing them from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>the deadly grasp of the tenacious creepers. The
waving cocoanut trees of Senana, the principal
island of the Soela-Bessir group, kiss the blue water
with sombre plumes, bowed down by the wealth of
heavy fruit lying in green and golden clusters
between frond and stem. The steamer anchors far
from the shore, and the launch proving unable to
cross the shallow bay, the landing of passengers can
only be accomplished by two crossed oars, carried
and steadied by four of the crew. The mode of progression
is wobbling and risky, but the improbability
of revisiting Senana supplied a mental argument
of unfailing force in balancing pros and cons. The
secluded island, so slightly influenced by the outside
world, changes but little with the lapse of time, and
the triple-tiered roofs of numerous thatched
<i>Messighits</i> rising above the palm-leaf huts of
the brown <i>campong</i>, assert the hereditary creed.
The green banner of Islam was planted here
centuries ago by a fanatical horde of Arab pirates,
who added religious enthusiasm to love of plunder
and thirst of conquest. Their fiery zeal, though not
according to knowledge, ensured a vigorous growth
of the foreign offshoot from the questionable faith of
these Arab corsairs, who left indelible traces on
the whole of the Malay Archipelago. The
<i>Messighits</i> of Senana are now only the ruined
shrines of a decadent creed, but the simple islanders
remain nominal adherents to the Monotheism of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>past. Canoes and <i>blotos</i>, rowed by lithe brown
figures, come out to welcome the steamer, and a
fantastic boat, with carven prow, darts from beneath
a green bower of tangled foliage, laden with golden
bananas. Merry-faced little savages line the shore,
eagerly awaiting the arrival of the white strangers,
who supply them with the amusement afforded by a
travelling circus to the more sophisticated children
of the West. An eager desire to please and gratify
the extraordinary visitors, mingles with the uncontrollable
delight, manifested in capering, dancing,
and gay laughter, as they beckon us to follow them
through the narrow lanes of the long <i>campong</i>.
Naked brown forms dash into their native huts at
sundry points of the route, to summon friends and
kinsfolk, until the procession swells into formidable
proportions, for the whole <i>campong</i> is eventually in
tow, with the exception of the men and boys
occupied in lading cargo. Through the dappled
sunlight and shadows of the sweeping palms which
flank the glassy bay, we are personally conducted
to the principal <i>Messighit</i>, a bare, whitewashed
building, without any decoration beyond the blue
and white tiles outlining the horse-shoe arch of the
<i>Mihrab</i> looking towards Mecca. The exterior
with three roofs of mossy thatch supported on
bamboo poles, offers a shelter from the sun on a
flight of crumbling steps, overshadowed by the
spreading eaves. A big cocoanut frond serves as an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>improvised broom in a dusky hand, and the central
step is carefully swept before the stranger, with
respectful salaams and gesticulations, is invited to
sit down. A turbaned <i>Imaum</i>, the custodian of
the decaying sanctuary, comes forth from his dilapidated
hut among the palms behind the shrine, at
the unwonted excitement breaking the silence and
solitude of the ancient mosque, but he evidently
belongs to the dreamland of the past, and retires
quickly from the disturbing present to meditations
or slumbers in his obscure dwelling, closing the
bamboo door against all intruders. This day's
incident of the cruise in the Malay Archipelago
seems absolutely cut off from ordinary experience&mdash;a
solitary Englishwoman, resting in the shadow of
the rustic mosque, and surrounded by a half-barbaric
tribe of unfamiliar aspect, the dark woolly hair, flat
noses, wide mouths, and dazzling teeth suggesting
a liberal admixture of negro or Papuan blood.
Native intelligence simplifies a halting conversation,
carried on by means of the indispensable Malayan
phrase-book. Wistful eyes rest on the stranger
whose lot is cast under happier auspices, and
unmistakeable characteristics manifest the Soela-Bessir
islanders as a gentle and teachable race.
Alas! the Dutch Government plants neither schools
nor missions in distant Senana, too far from the
beaten track to commend itself to the religious or
educational care of a nation apparently indifferent to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>the claims of small communities, in the vast Archipelago
subject to Holland. Only the quarterly call
of the Dutch steamer stirs the stagnation of ages on
the Soela-Bessir isles, but although the young,
sharing in that wondrous heritage of mirth and
gladness peculiar to the joyous early life of the
tropics, recognise no limitations in their lot, the
mothers sadly repeat the complaint heard elsewhere
that no chance of improvement is given to them.
The steamer, frequently bringing hither the inhabitants
of more favoured islands in the interests of
trade, already begins to stir feelings of unrest, and
vague longings for the better things as yet withheld.
A chieftain's daughter joins the throng round
the old <i>messighit</i>. A red-cotton drapery, thrown
over bronze limbs, is her only garment, but a
diamond glistening on her dark hand looks
incongruous with the scanty clothing. The gem
seems a talisman or heirloom, but a request to
examine it terrifies the owner, and she rushes away
into the woods to safeguard the precious possession
from perils suggested by the presence of the white
pilgrim from across the seas. The delicious breeze
which always spring up after ten o'clock in these
latitudes renders walking a delight, the two following
hours being invariably cooler than the trying time
between eight and ten, when the fierce sun, on a
level with the face, creates an atmosphere of
blistering glare. The brown procession forms an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>orderly escort to the lading shed beneath a clump of
tall cocoa-palms, and the kindly merchant who
negotiates the commerce of the Soela-Bessir isles
for the Dutch Government, sends a native boy up
the smooth stem of a colossal tree in search of a
fresh cocoanut, which fills two tumblers with
refreshing sap. The thatched <i>campong</i> stands
against a background of green hills and dense
woods, rich in tropical verdure, but lacking the
loveliness of the Moluccas. The return to the ship
involves a <i>bloto</i> across the bay, with many
misgivings as to the seaworthy capacities of the
clumsy craft, but four bamboo safety-poles, fastened
by forked sticks to the sides of the hollowed log,
suffice to steady it enough to avoid capsizal. In the
Soela-Bessir Isles, as in many other far-off and
forgotten regions, the genius of commerce begins to
awaken the desire of civilisation in untutored hearts,
for Trade sharing in the romance no longer regarded
as the exclusive attribute of Art or Science, now
helps to fuse opposing elements into unity and order.
The simple inhabitants of distant Senana seem only
waiting for an outstretched hand to lift them to a
higher level of creed and culture, for the modern
pioneers of missionary enterprise raise the superstructure
of Christianity with unexampled success
on the substratum of truth contained even in
imperfect and erroneous creeds. That solid foundation
stone of belief in the One Eternal God, laid by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Arab pirates centuries ago, amid the lust of rapine
and the smoke of war, which ever heralded the
onward march of conquering Islam, should serve as
a firm basis for building up these simple children of
Nature into the mystical sanctuary of the Christian
Church. The lapse of time obliterates countless
landmarks of Moslem creed in localities removed
from external contact, but amid the dust of disintegrating
forces and forgotten forms, the central
Truth remains imbedded, like a wedge of gold
trodden in the mire, but retaining intrinsic value
and untarnishable purity.</p>

<h3>THE WESTERN COAST AND THE HIGHLANDS.</h3>


<p>Passing through the straits of Saleir, between a
cliff-bound island and the south-eastern Cape of
Celebes, the returning steamer in due time reaches
her moorings in Sourabaya, and a rapid railway
journey through Java connects with the outgoing
boat from Batavia to Padang, a three days' voyage
through a chain of green islands breaking the force
of the monsoon on a desolate and harbourless shore.
The forest-clad ranges of Sumatra draw nearer at
Benkoelen, buried in cocoa-palms on the rim of a
quiet bay, within a terrific reef which makes landing
impossible in stormy weather. Fort and Residency,
villas and gardens, manifest Benkoelen as an oasis
of civilisation, the steeply-tiled roofs remaining as
relics of the English occupation a century ago.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>Beyond the little military settlement, the Sumatran
mountains tower in majestic gloom beyond a broken
line of bristling crags, like granite outworks guarding
the eleven hundred miles of coast-line facing the
Indian Ocean. The rugged backbone of mysterious
Sumatra, descending sharply to the western sea,
overlooks a vast alluvial plain on the eastern side,
where rice and sugar-cane, coffee and tobacco,
flourish between the wide deltas of sluggish rivers,
though rushing streams and wild cascades characterise
the opposite shore. Ridges and bastions of
rock, above profound valleys, culminate in cloud-capped
Indrapura, at a height of 12,000 feet.
Geologists affirm the vast age of Sumatra, indicated
by the Silurian rock, the bastions of granite, the
extraordinary vegetation fossilised in the huge coal-beds,
and the sandstone formation, often a thousand
feet thick, carved by time and weather into fantastic
ravines. Inexhaustible mineral wealth lies hidden
in these weird ranges, together with the costly
chemical products of a volcanic soil, but the rich
treasures of the virgin rocks are for the most part
unknown and unexplored. Columns of smoke rise
continually from numerous active volcanos, and the
beautiful mountain lakes fill extinct craters. The
great island, lying north-west and south-east,
possesses a glorious climate, and the superb vegetation
shows a distinctive character from that of Java.
The Dutch, though supreme on the coast, have never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>yet subdued the interior, and unconquerable Acheen
remains a perpetual centre of unrest. The flower of
the Malay race belongs to Sumatra, and the wild
Battek tribes of alien origin are fast merging themselves
into the dominant stock, though the
Redjanger clan, retaining curious customs of a
remote past, and possessing a written character, cut
with a <i>kris</i> on strips of bamboo, is slow to assimilate
itself to the Malayan element. The Sumatran
language shows traces of Indian and Arabic
influence, and that the early civilisation of the huge
island was of Hindu origin is evidenced by innumerable
Sanskrit words, and by the fact that the
consecrated pipal tree, the "Ficus Religiosa" of
India, remains to this day the sacred tree of the
Batteks. Native chronicles record the descent of
Sumatran princes from Alexander the Great, but
though the pages of Javanese history are comparatively
legible, those of Sumatra, designated in early
days as "the older Java," resemble a dim
palimpsest, marred by erasure or hiatus, and barely
decipherable beneath the lettering on the surface of
the age-worn parchment.</p>

<p>Little <i>campongs</i> of palm-thatched huts stand
on piles at the water's edge, and skirt the over-shadowing
forest; fairy islands, encircled with red-stemmed
<i>ar&eacute;n</i>-palms, lie like green garlands on the
indigo sea, dotted with the yellow sails of native
<i>proas</i>, and the little train which conveys us to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>Padang, the western capital, seems an incongruous
feature in a scene suggestive of primeval peace and
solitude. A sylvan charm belongs even to this
Sumatran township, for the wooden houses, with
pointed roofs of dried palm-leaves, and broad eaves
forming shady verandahs, stand far apart in flowery
gardens, aflame with orange or scarlet cannas, and
fragrant with golden-hearted frangipanni. The
sweeping boughs of giant cocoanut trees make a
green twilight beneath their interwoven fronds,
Bougainvillea drapes crumbling wall and forest tree
with curtains of roseate purple, and thatched stalls
of tropical fruits and glowing flowers brighten
the dusky avenues with patches of vivid colour.
The determined aspect of the Sumatran people
denotes the superior calibre of the ancestral stock
which colonised the Archipelago, for foreign intercourse,
which elsewhere modified national character,
scarcely affected the Sumatran Malays, independent
of the servile yoke imposed by the mighty
princes of Java. The forty <i>Soekoes</i>, or clans, of
Sumatra, are sub-divided into branches consisting of
numerous families, all descended from a common
stock in the female line. This curiously constituted
pedigree is known as the Matriarchate, an ancient
social system only retained in Western Sumatra,
and among certain South American tribes.
The resolute mien and dignified carriage of the
Sumatran woman denote clear consciousness of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>supreme importance. The cringing submission so
painfully characteristic of Oriental womanhood is
wholly unknown, and though nominally of Mohammedan
faith, the humble position prescribed by the
Kor&aacute;n to the female sex is a forgotten article of
Sumatra's hereditary creed. After marriage (forbidden
between members of the same clan) both man
and woman remain in their own family circle. The
husband is only an occasional visitor, and the wife
is regarded as the head of the house. Her children
remain under her exclusive care, and inherit her
property, together with the half of what their father
and mother earn together. The other half goes to
the brothers and sisters of the husband, whose titles
descend to his own brothers and sisters. Sumatra is
veritably El Dorado to the Eastern wife and mother,
conversant with every detail respecting the management
of land or money, and jealously guarding the
time-honoured rights and privileges of her exalted
position.</p>

<p>The hereditary chieftains of Sumatran clans
exercise a patriarchal rule of uncompromising
severity, and combine in every district to form the
<i>Laras</i> or local Council, the distance separating
forest and mountain <i>campongs</i> often necessitating
sub-division into a village assembly. The
<i>Laras</i>, and those rural chieftains nominated by
popular consent, possess a seat on the Supreme
Council of the Dutch Government, thus forming the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>transitional element between Asiatic and European
rule. There is no Sumatran nobility, and although
the hereditary chief of a clan is invested with official
authority, the stringent regulations of the Matriarchate
acknowledge no superiority of social status
as an appanage of his power.</p>

<p>The hothouse atmosphere of Padang is gladly
exchanged for the freshness of the mountain
heights, approached by a cog-wheel railway,
and affording truer pictures of Sumatran life
than the hybrid port of the steaming Lowlands.
The luxuriant verdure of the swampy
plain basks in the sunshine of a blazing March day,
and children in gaudy <i>sarongs</i> drive a brisk trade
at palm-thatched wayside stations, with bamboo
trays of sliced pineapple sprinkled with capsicum,
the approved "pick-me-up" of Sumatra. The little
train burrows through a forest-lined pass, and skirts
the chafing waters of the Anei river, foaming over
swarthy boulders. The turbulent stream, now
deeply sunk between granite cliffs, rises with terrific
violence when lashed by the wild mountain wind
known as the <i>bandjir</i>, and rushes up the rocky
walls, overthrowing bridges, and dragging along
immense crags with resistless impetus. The shrill
laughter of the black bush-apes echoes from sombre
masses of matted foliage, as the train ascends the
lofty range, and curves round the basin of a
sparkling waterfall, dashing from a fern-draped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>height. Granite cliffs soar above tropical jungle
and solemn forest; the narrow gap of the Anei
widens into a luxuriant valley; sago-palms rustle in
the breeze, and tree-ferns spread their green canopies
over the brawling river. The splendid scenery is
viewed to advantage from a platform of the foremost
railway carriage, the train being pushed up the
mountains by an engine in the rear. Beyond the
climbing forests, a bare plateau affords a glimpse of
ever-burning Merapi, with wooded flanks and lava-strewn
summit, from whence a grey cloud of smoke
mounts in a spiral curl to the azure sky. Beyond
this point of view lies the green plain of beautiful
Fort de Kock, the gem of the Sumatran Highlands,
to be numbered henceforth among those ideal scenes
which remain permanently photographed on mind
and memory. The crystalline atmosphere seems the
very breath of life after a long sojourn in the
steaming tropics, and Fort de Kock, under the
shadow of mysterious Merapi, an Elysium of health
and repose. The little Hotel Jansen offers clean and
comfortable accommodation, the kindly German
hostess proving a model landlady. As a Residency
and the headquarters of a Dutch garrison. Fort de
Kock provides all the necessaries of life, and the
broad military roads of the vicinity simplify
exploration. The little white settlement beneath
the wooded volcano possesses a bright and cheery
character, in keeping with the exhilarating climate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>and the beautiful Sturm Park, from palm-crowned
hill and flowery terrace, commands an exquisite
prospect of the blue peaks belonging to the borderland
of those Native States extending to the Dutch
possessions on the Eastern coast. The curious
houses of the Sumatran Highlands, with their
adjacent rice-barns, form distinctive features of this
unique island. The ridge of the steep thatch rises
in sharp horns, interlaced with black fibres of <i>ar&eacute;n</i>
palm, or covered with glittering tin. These tapering
points are considered talismans of good fortune, a
fresh horn being added on every occasion of
marriage, for the married daughters, under the
provisions of the Matriarchate, remain in the home
of their childhood, and portions of the central
division belonging to the house are reserved for their
use. Manifold horns frequently bristle above the
lofty roof, and the front of the main building is the
common living room for unmarried members of the
large household. Houses and rice-barns stand on
high poles, after the Malay fashion, which originated
in the malarious districts of the Lowlands. The
typical rice-barns are lavishly decorated with gilding,
carving, and colour, inlaid with glass mosaic, and
edged with balls of red and blue crystal, the upward
sweep of the slender horns sharply silhouetted
against the glowing cobalt of heaven. In every
<i>kota</i> (the Sumatran word signifying a fortified
place, or village), the beauty of the picturesque
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>roofs culminates in <i>Messighit</i> and <i>Balei</i>, respectively
the Mosque and Hall of Consultation for the
Village Council. The roofs of the Mosque rise on
thatched tiers, mounted on slender pine-stems, and
the long <i>Balei</i>, with mossy thatch prolonged into
an open verandah on either side, shows a multitude
of curving horns pointing to Heaven, and
symbolically invoking celestial aid for the solemn
assembly gathered beneath them, when the full
moon floods upland Sumatra with molten silver.
Primitive hospitality provides a <i>roemah negari</i>,
or "House of Strangers," in every village rich
enough to erect this refuge for the toil-worn
wanderer, but where no special resting-place for
pilgrims can be offered, lodging can always be had in
the open <i>Balei</i>, on application to any member of
the Village Council. The primitive simplicity of
Sumatran life remains practically unchanged in
these remote hamlets of the Western Highlands, and
though Fort de Kock poses as the nucleus of
modern progress, European influences glance off the
indurated surface of native character like water
poured over a granite slab.</p>

<p>Across the rice-plain of Agam, dotted with brown
<i>kotas</i>, crowned by myriads of interweaving
horns, we reach the scattered village of Paja-Kombo,
shadowed by dense woods of cocoanut
palms, and famed for one of the most picturesque
native markets in the East. The women of Paja-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>Kombo
are noted for their beauty, enhanced by the
splendour of many-coloured <i>sarongs</i>, gleaming with
gold and silver thread. Gay turbans swathe the
stately heads, and the golden filagree of barbaric
breastplates, heavy earrings, and broad armlets,
lights up the shadowy gloom of stone galleries and
<i>al fresco</i> stalls, beneath the drooping boughs of
ancient waringen-trees. The Sumatran Malays are
energetic traders, and the dignified personality of
the Sumatran woman is perpetually in evidence.
Keen, thrifty, economical, and thoroughly versed in
all the details of commerce, she shows herself the
predominant partner in domestic life, and to her all
decisions on financial matters are referred, in accordance
with the laws of the Matriarchate, which
protects her independence. The husbands and
fathers in attendance on their womankind at the
great Market, submissively defer to the gentler sex,
which in Sumatra has ever held the reins of social
and domestic management, exercising authority
wisely and well within the wide area deputed to
feminine sway. The Fair of Paja-Kombo is a
treasury of native Art in most delicate filigree,
silver-threaded cloth, baskets or fans of scented
grass, and the heavy jewellery of burnished brass
which copies the designs of the many golden heirlooms
treasured by Sumatran womanhood. Streets
of palm-thatched stalls, alleys of eating-houses, and
the wide enclosure of a Mule-Fair, cover an open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>meadow, fringed by great sago-palms, the central
grain and rice Market crowded with picturesque
figures in striped <i>sarong</i> and gold-flecked turban.
The feast of colour provided by Paja-Kombo is
scarcely surpassed even by the famous Fair of
Darjeeling, the remoteness of the little settlement
in the Sumatran Highlands preserving the unfaded
charm of an immemorial past. The wonderful Gap
of Harau may be reached by cart from Paja-Kombo;
the palm-shaded road narrows at the mighty gorge,
where vermilion cliffs, grooved and ribbed as though
by some convulsion of Nature, tower up in colossal
majesty on either side. Splendid waterfalls flash
down in foam and thunder, scoring deep channels in
the perpendicular heights, and bathing thickets
of tree-fern and maidenhair in pearly spray.
A wild river swirls through the deep ravine, opening
towards the ethereal blue of clustering peaks, which
lie fold upon fold in the hazy distance of the
Native States, and disclose a mystic pathway into
dreamland.</p>

<p>Another deep gully of yellow tufa-rock behind
Fort de Kock, forms the first stage of the romantic
route to Lake Manindjoe. Crossing the twin rivers
which have carved their winding gorge in the bosom
of the hills, the rude track through the mountains
ascends to smooth plateaux forming a flight of
gigantic stairs, supported by rocky girders like
natural cross-beams. In early days of Dutch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>colonisation these successive points of vantage,
occupied by hostile tribes, were stormed in vain by
the invading army, and eventually only captured by
surprise. The beauty of upland Sumatra culminates
at this mountain lake, lying within the foundered
crater of the Danau. The volcanic walls rise
fourteen hundred feet above the dark blue mere,
a glitting sheet of <i>lapis lazuli</i> set within the black
cleft of the profound chasm. Brown and purple
rocks enamelled with orange lichen, and garlanded
with waving verdure, open to display a mysterious
vision of the glistening sea, with one white sail like
a butterfly's wing, crossing the distant waves. The
flushing rose-tints of a tropical sunset glorify the
landscape into transcendent beauty; the rude
sculpture of the river crags, the black shadows of
primeval forest, and the far-off gleam of the Indian
Ocean, composing an ideal picture, enhanced by
vague impressions of Infinity and Eternity.</p>

<p>The great Lake of Sinkarah, flanked by volcanic
ridges, and by the dense foliage of palm forests and
coffee plantations, also presents a succession of
entrancing landscapes. White and purple orchids
wreathe the forest trees, troops of red monkeys
chatter among the boughs, and woodland vistas
reveal leagues of emerald rice and golden millet.
Beyond Sinkarah lies the famous coal district of the
island, where Chinamen, convicts, and Hindu
coolies, in perpetual bustle and commotion, manifest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>an activity unique in the thinly-populated interior of
Sumatra, dependent on the labour of alien races.
Javanese act as woodmen, gardeners, and road-makers;
the Klings serve as cowherds and drivers
of ox-waggons; the Bengalese prove efficient policemen,
and the Boyans skilful carpenters; the clearing
of the forest pertaining to Malays and Batteks, also
responsible for the building of the marvellous rice-barns,
the apotheosis of Sumatran architecture.
The ordinary tourist omits Sumatra from his
itinerary. Occasional elephant-hunters penetrate
the dense forests of the interior, and engineers or
tobacco-planters flock to the monotonous levels of
the eastern coast, but the glorious Western
Highlands, the Sumatran <i>Bovenland</i>, is seldom
visited. Warlike Acheen, for ever at feud with
the Dutch Government, is forbidden ground
to the European traveller. The unconquerable
independence of the Achinese, fiercely resenting
the sovereignty of Holland, proves an insoluble
problem to the Dutch methods of subjugation.
The bold and lawless character of this
rebellious clan defies military discipline. The spirit
of insurrection animates every man, woman, and
child of the brave but treacherous race, and Acheen
remains the dark centre of countless tragedies, due
to the spurious patriotism which counts a stab in
the dark, a poisoned arrow, or a cruel betrayal, as
heroic and laudable modes of resistance to the hated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>invader of Sumatra's ancient liberties. The forest-clad
interior of the vast island remains an unknown
wilderness. Cannibals still lurk in the black depths
of the pathless jungle; weird tribal customs linger
unchanged in barbarous <i>campongs</i>, where strange
gods are worshipped with the immemorial rites of
an ageless past, rude carvings and weird symbols
showing the personification of those natural phenomena
deified by primeval tribes. Sumatra, with
her wealth of mines and forests and her important
geographical position, remains as yet an almost
undiscovered country, and though her undeveloped
resources excite the cupidity and arouse the envy of
European nations, political greed and private enterprise
have proved powerless to open up the hidden
treasures of the vast island, apparently intended by
Nature to become the key of the Southern Seas.</p>

<h3>A VIEW OF KRAKATAU.</h3>


<p>Emma-Haven, the little port of Padang, twenty
minutes by train from the palm-girt Sumatran
capital, scarcely mars the beauty of the secluded
inlet with the red and white warehouses standing
against the sylvan verdure which fringes the blue arc
of the deep bay. Cloud upon cloud, the spectral
vision of distant mountains gleams through the
vanishing veil of mist melting in the sunrise, and
the departing steamer, hugging the shore, but
halting for cargo at sundry barbaric <i>campongs</i>,
affords numerous glimpses of native life. Passengers
are forbidden to land at these rural ports of call, for
a herd of twenty frolicsome elephants battered down
one brown village of palm-thatched bamboo only a
week ago, and although the ruined architecture
possesses the advantage of being as easily restored
as destroyed, the unpleasant proximity of the dark
jungle suggests the need of prudence. At another
point of the little voyage, we anchor for a cargo of
rattan before a thatched shed on a shell-strewn
beach, but even here a solitary elephant, disturbed in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>bathing, has lately attacked a woman, rescued with
difficulty from formidable tusks and lashing trunk.
A tribe of coolies come on board from the pepper
plantation on a terraced hill, covered with the
vivid green of the festooning creeper, twined round
long poles, and resembling hop-vines in growth and
foliage. The landing of this contingent involves a
call at Anjer, the northern extremity of Java,
distinguished by the white column of the colossal
Pharos on the green headland. A halt at nightfall
outside a bristling reef, in consequence of a Malay
lighthouse-keeper omitting to trim his lamp, after
the fashion of his unthinking kind, secures the
compensation of steaming within sight of world-famous
Krakatau, the volcanic cone, which in 1883
was split in half by the stupendous eruption affecting
in various degrees the whole of the world. The
successive waves of atmospherical disturbance,
travelling with the velocity of sound, were traced
three times completely round the globe. Krakatau,
though uninhabited, was the occasional resort of
fishermen who plied their calling in the Sunda
Straits. A Dutch record exists of a violent eruption
in 1680, but the Krakatau volcano was afterwards
considered extinct, and until the spring of 1883 no
signs of activity occurred. At this date, smoke,
pumice, and cinders, fell without intermission. For
eight weeks Krakatau blazed and thundered, the
explosions being audible at Batavia, eighty miles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>off. As the fatal dawn of an August morning
broke with lurid light, the culminating shock of an
appalling detonation, described as "the very crack
and crash of doom," echoed across the ocean, and
was heard even in India and Australia, two thousand
miles away. Gigantic tidal waves swept the
Sundanese shores, destroying the adjacent villages,
36,000 people being either washed away or buried
under the boiling rain of mud, fire, and ashes. The
Royal Society estimated the altitude of the vast
black and crimson column of flame and smoke,
mounting from the volcano, at seventeen miles.
The ashes fell at Singapore and on the Cocos Isles,
respectively five and eight hundred miles away, the
ejection of volcanic matter being computed at more
than four cubic miles in extent. Krakatau, reduced
from thirteen to six square miles, from the northern
portion of the symmetrical pyramid being completely
blown away by the volcanic fires, retains the conical
peak of Mount Radaka, nearly three thousand feet
high. Some of the contiguous islands sank beneath
the waves, others changed their shape, and the
formation of various banks and shoals added fresh
difficulties to the intricate navigation of reef-bound
seas. Thrilling stories are told of the enveloping pall
of smoke and ashes, which shrouded Java in
midnight gloom, amid the continuous roar of
violent explosions which led up to the awful
climax of the final catastrophe. Red-hot stones
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>and burning cinders fired the ships, the weight
of pumice sinking <i>praus</i> and fishing smacks as it
fell into the hissing sea, and a 600-ton schooner,
thrown by the force of the world-shaking concussion
into a mountain cleft of the opposite coast, still lies
wedged between the black walls of rock. The
floating pumice, which filled the harbour of Batavia
with layers so deep that planks resting upon it made
a safe bridge over a mile in length, drifted even to
Zanzibar and Madagascar. The fine dust, expelled
into the upper air, painted the sunset heavens with
these translucent green and violet tints which
enhanced the pageantry of cloudland throughout the
world for many months after the fiery forces had
expended themselves. Smoke still issues from
Krakatau, though the vast rent in the cloven
pyramid must materially diminish the power of any
future eruption, and Nature's busy hand already
covers the torn side of the precipitous cone with
a green veil of sparse vegetation. A curious marine
growth of weed and moss rooted itself on Krakatau
three years after the phenomenal eruption, from
seeds floating on the tide or carried by the wind.
The thin soil formed by these decaying plants, and
enriched by the chemical ingredients of disintegrating
volcanic ash, in time produced a more luxuriant
verdure, and in the interval elapsing since the
threefold ravages of fire, flood, and earthquake,
caused by Krakatau, convulsed the East with terror,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>the dread mountain has become wreathed with flower
and fruit, for orchards and gardens, tended by the
Malays from the surrounding islands, now flourish
at the foot of the quiescent peak. Javanese colonists,
who experienced the terrors of the overwhelming
catastrophe, assert that no similes drawn from the
most appalling thunderstorm, or from the roar of
the heaviest artillery, could convey an adequate idea
of the stupendous detonation which seemed to
shatter earth and sky, as the pent-up fires burst
forth in the final explosion, which tore the mountain
asunder and poured forth the devastating forces of
the abysmal depths over land and sea. Crimson
lava-flood and burning hail, blackened heaven and
rocking earth, roaring sea and clamouring volcano,
represented an Apocalyptic vision of Divine wrath,
but probably no survivor remained to record
the actual sight of the unprecedented phenomenon,
transcending every terrestrial convulsion recorded in
the chronicles of scientists. Only a slender feather
of grey steam now issues from the lofty crater.
Leaves and grasses flutter in the soft breeze, and a
shower of white petals drifts upon the iron boulders,
once incandescent amid the red torrents of rushing
fire. A sheer precipice remained as the severed half
of the shattered cone, when the rent cliffs shivered
into fragments, and toppled over into the sea.
Nature again breathes "peace and safety," as she
did before "the sudden destruction" gave the lie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>to her mocking voice, and as the ruined pyramid of
terrible Krakatau sinks below the horizon, and the
good ship speeds on her way, a weight of awe seems
lifted from the mind, oppressed by imagination
and association with the ghastly tragedy of
those untameable forces which defy calculation or
comprehension.</p>

<p>History has often proved the truth of the
assertion that Time turns memories into dreams, but
in the presence of Krakatau's smoking crater, the
memories looming over the haunted volcano translate
themselves into a nightmare of horror, for the
shadows of doom still cling to the monumental
pyramid, a menacing witness to the existence of
those occult laws which baffle human investigation
with their insoluble problems, and compel the
defeated scientist to acknowledge himself a mere
chronicler of inexplicable mysteries. The extent
of the volcanic zone encircling the Malay Archipelago
minimises the risk of catastrophe by
numerous safety valves for the imprisoned forces of
Earth's fiery abyss. In isolated Krakatau only one
outlet existed for the vast accumulations of destructive
agencies, gathering irresistible impetus through
the protracted period of condensation and suppression
which heated this mighty furnace of
Nature's subterranean laboratory with sevenfold
power. A generation has grown up since the hell of
devouring fire swept across land and sea from this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>solitary mountain peak; villages have been rebuilt
on their ancient sites, and the activities of life go
on from year to year undisturbed. The story of
Krakatau, told under the drooping boughs of dusky
waringen-trees in the evening hour of leisure, seems
veiled in the mists of legendary lore to youth and
maiden, listening to the oft-told tale. Poverty
clings to familiar soil, and in the deep groove of a
narrow existence the popular mind takes little
thought for the future. The realities of life are
bounded by the daily needs, and the shadow of
Krakatau fails to destroy the present peace of the
simple folk, who, like children gathering flowers on
the edge of a precipice, heed none of the grim
possibilities of a perilous environment.</p>

<h3>PENANG.</h3>


<p>Poelo-Penang, <i>The Isle of the areca-nut</i>, separated
by a narrow strait from the Malay Peninsula,
was ceded to England in 1785 by the Rajah
of Kedah, from whom the present Sultan of
Johore is lineally descended. The little territory,
chiefly consisting of a mountain covered with palm-forests,
was then almost uninhabited, but the
strategetic importance of the position resulted in the
establishment of an English Presidency, until the
phenomenal growth of Singapore made it the
eventual centre of local authority. "Sinhapura,"
"the City of Lions" (or, more accurately, of tigers),
founded by the Hinduized Malays, and developed by
Sir Stamford Raffles into the principal trading port
of the Eastern seas, of necessity drew off from
Penang a large contingent of the polyglot races
which flocked thither from all parts, when the
British flag first waved above the newly-built fort,
but at least 100,000 inhabitants still occupy the
verdant island, where the graceful areca palm attains
unexampled perfection. Penang was merely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>regarded as an unimportant appendage of ancient
Malacca, captured in 1311 by Albuquerque, and
though the territory of the principal Sultan underwent
innumerable vicissitudes through the changing
fortunes of war, the royal line retained Johore at
the foot of the Peninsula, up to the present day, the
last scion of the old-world dynasty now accepting
the suzerainty of England.</p>

<p>A tribe of Klings (the Malay corruption of the
word Telinga), sailing from the Coromandel coast,
were the first immigrants under British rule.
The half-breed Indian Malays, or <i>Jawi-Pekan</i>,
followed, and the Chinese, finding a new outlet for
their commercial genius, soon secured a firm footing
on the fairy isle, a cone of emerald set in a sapphire
sea. As the rickshaw wheels away from the noisy
wharves of busy Georgetown into green aisles of
areca and cocoanut, the spice-laden breeze blowing
from the heights, and mingled with the breath of a
thousand flowers, suggests Penang as "the mountain
of myrrh, and hill of frankincense," described
in the Canticle of Canticles. Present surroundings
atone for the lack of life's amenities in the Dutch
dependencies. The ripple of the sea, and the rustle
of swaying palms, just stir the silence of the wave-washed
terrace above the glassy straits. The
gloomy blue of the Kedah mountains on the peninsula
of Malacca, with black thunderclouds gathering
round their serrated crests, heightens the brilliant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>loveliness of immediate surroundings, steeped in the
ruby glow of the magical evening. Every road is
an over-arching avenue of gorgeous foliage&mdash;dark
tunnels of interwoven cocoa-palms, huge Amherstias
alight as with lamps of fiery orange, tremulous
tamarinds, and, more wonderful than all, a wide
highway roofed by a continuous aisle of ansena-trees,
the golden canopy of blossom overhead rivalled
by the thick carpet of yellow petals, which deadens
every sound, for the prodigal bounty of tropical
Nature quickly replaces the loss of falling flowers.
Exquisite lanes, smothered in glorious vegetation,
surround the picturesque Racecourse, that <i>sine-q&ucirc;a-non</i>
of English occupation. Stately emperor palms,
kitools with crimped green tresses, fan and oil palms,
with the slender areca in countless thousands, vary
the shadowy vistas branching out in every direction,
with huge-leaved creepers and glossy rattans garlanding
the gnarled trunks of forest-trees. The
sculptured outlines of the splendid traveller's palm
adorn the green lawns of European bungalows,
embowered in torrents of trailing creepers, the scale
of colour descending from white and pink to royal
purple and burning crimson. Snowy arums and
golden lilies choke the brooks, overflowing from the
constant showers combining with a vertical sun to
foster the wealth of greenery, the incandescent
scarlet and yellow of hybiscus and allemanda
glowing with the transparent depth of hue, beside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>which the fragile fairness of European flowers, is but
a spectral reflection of those colour-drenched blossoms
fused into jewelled lustre by the solar fires. Night
drops her black curtain suddenly, with no intervening
veil of twilight to temper Earth's plunge into
darkness. Great stars hang low in the sombre sky,
and the open interiors of Malay huts, aglow with
lamp or torchlight, produce Rembrandtesque effects,
revealing brown inmates cooking or eating their
"evening rice."</p>

<p>Georgetown, loyally named by British pioneers
after a monarch eminently incongruous with any
ideas belonging to a tropical fairyland, possesses
neither architectural beauty nor salient character;
wooden warehouses, Malay shanties, and white-washed
streets being merely attractive from the
ever-changing scheme of colour painted by varieties
of race and costume. Tamils of ebon blackness
drive picturesque teams of humped white oxen in
red waggons laden with purple sugar-cane. Noble-looking
Sikhs, in spotless linen, stride past with
kingly gait. Brown Siamese, in many-coloured
scarves and turbans gleaming with gold thread,
chaffer and bargain at open stalls with blue-robed
Chinamen, and the bronze figures of slim Malays,
brightened by mere wisps of orange and scarlet
added to Nature's durable suit, slip through the
crowds, pausing before an emporium of polished
brass-work, or a bamboo stall of teak wood carving.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>The sloping black mitre of a stout Parsee merchant,
accompanied by a pretty daughter in white head-band
and floating <i>sari</i> of cherry-coloured silk, varies
the motley headgear of turban and fez, straw hat and
sun-helmet, worn by this cosmopolitan population,
the pink headkerchiefs, tinselled scarves, and
jewelled buttons of the beautiful Burmese dress,
drawing attention to the energetic bargaining of
two astute customers for cooking utensils; these
elegantly-attired but mahogany-coloured dames,
rivalling the Sumatran women in business capacity,
and equally determined on securing the <i>quid pro quo</i>.
The long esplanade between town and sea borders a
series of green lawns, where carriages draw up
round a bandstand, and the youthful element of
European Penang plays tennis with laudable zeal
in the atmosphere of a stove-house. Chinese and
Malay boyhood look on, and listen to the regimental
music. The pallid English occupants of the
carriages, in spite of diaphanous muslins and
fluttering fans, appear too limp and wilted to bestow
more than a languid attention to their surroundings,
until the sea-breeze, springing up as the sun
declines, revives their flagging spirits. The
smartest turnout and the finest horses generally
belong to John Chinaman, got up in irreproachable
English costume, with his pigtail showing beneath a
straw hat, though considerably attenuated, and
lacking those adornments of silken braid and red
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>tassels, generally plaited into the imposing queue
of the orthodox Celestial. The indefatigable
Chinese, frequently arriving on an alien shore without
a dollar in their pockets, continually prove
potential millionaires. Immune from climatic
diseases, working early and late, tolerant and
unaggressive, the iron hand in the velvet glove
disentangles and grasps the threads of the most
complicated commercial enterprise, for the idle
Malay, "the gentleman of the East," here as elsewhere,
cares for little beyond the sport of hunting
and fish-spearing, which satisfies the personal
necessities of his indolent existence. The wonderful
solidarity of domestic life is an important factor in
the Chinese career, for centuries of ancestor-worship,
in spite of their arrestive tendency, have
strengthened the bonds of family union and filial
obedience by insisting on the supreme sanctity of
blood-relationship.</p>

<p>The luxuriant Botanical Garden, situated in a
green cleft of an angle formed by encircling hills,
is a paradise of dreamland, though but a miniature
when compared with Buitenzorg for extent and
variety. In the restful charm of the Penang garden
Art and Nature go hand in hand, giving it an unique
character among the horticultural pleasaunces of the
Eastern world. The rolling lawns of the exquisite
valley, the song of the waterfall which bounds the
view as it leaps down the lofty cliffs, the abundant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>shade of tamarind and palm, and the gorgeous
flowering shrubs, suggest nothing artificial or conventionalised
in the deep seclusion of the fairy glen.
Tall bamboos mirror fluffy foliage and white or
golden stems in stream and pool. Orchids of the
Brazils festoon unknown trees with the rose and
purple butterflies formed by their brilliant blossoms,
and colossal traveller's palms, so-called from the
draught of water obtained by incision of the
stem, stud the glades with stiffly-fluted fans. Lilac
thunbergia wreaths over-arching boughs, and
passion-flower flings white and crimson garlands
over turf flushed with the pink blossoms of the
sensitive plant. Gold mohur and red poinsettia
blaze with fiery splendour, and huge crotons, with
velvety leaves of pink, violet, and chocolate, grow
to the height of forest trees. The tangle of brilliant
flowers, systematically arranged by the concealed
art of the Eastern horticulturist, shows many weird
botanical forms. Green spears, bristling on mossy
banks, are starred with crimson and barred with
orange. Wine-coloured cacti twist blue-green
spikes and stems in grotesque contortions, and topaz
or ruby-tinted calladiums flame in thickets of hot
colour outside cool green dells, filled by a forest of
tropical ferns, mosses, and creepers. Lack of
botanical knowledge constitutes a sore disadvantage
in this treasury of floral beauty, but happily we may
"consider the lilies," without cataloguing them, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>this garden, "beautiful for situation," and worthy
to be a "joy of the whole earth." The sombre
jungle on the mountain side supplies the atmosphere
of mystery which enhances the ideal peace of the
cloistered Paradise, wrapt in the embrace of the
haunted hills, and numbered among those visions of
an earlier Eden, only realised in the Asiatic birthplace
of Humanity which contained the typical
Garden of the World, Divinely planted, where the
Voice from Heaven deepened the music of whispering
leaves and sighing breeze.</p>

<p>A purple-red pat&mdash;for even the jasper-tinted
tropical soil is beautiful, climbs through the glorious
woods to the chief Sanatorium of the Malay Peninsula.
A free fight among the coolies before starting
demands a lengthy exercise of that stolidity with
which the Western pilgrim must invest himself, as
the invulnerable armour needed by the conflict of
daily life. As a mere matter of personal convenience,
this quality bears scant resemblance to the weapons
enumerated by S. Paul in the Christian panoply.
The oppressive heat, the futility of argument in an
almost unknown tongue, and the general uncertainty
of the subject in dispute, gradually producing this
spurious virtue as the external decoration of sorely-exasperated
souls. The exertion of the long ascent
in the steaming heat requires six coolies for every
chair. The red road mounts through enchanting
vistas of palms and creepers, on the edge of the dark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>jungle, each turning point bringing a whiff of cooler
air, as the evening gold flickers through the velvety
fronds of tree-ferns, and the green feathers of
spreading bamboos. From the white hotel near the
summit, the blue Straits and the flats of Province
Wellesley, the English portion of the Malay Peninsula,
stand out against the frowning ridge of
mountains, for black thunder-clouds continually
brood over Malacca. Monkeys caper and chatter in
the teak-trees bordering a circular terrace, and an
ideal sylvan path leads to the Signal Station,
Hospital, and Post Office, on an opposite height,
dotted with the bungalows of summer visitors. A
palm-shaded plateau beneath the hotel offers an ideal
resting-place, but the impenetrable jungle covering
the Penang Hills makes expeditions on foot or by
chair, impracticable, and the wild deluges of rain,
with terrific thunder peals bursting in uncontrolled
fury on this exposed peak, minimise the delights of
a mountain sojourn. The invasion of an army of
jungle rats, behind the walls and above the ceiling
of a room sodden and dripping with the afternoon's
flood, completes the disillusion, and compels a hasty
descent to the warmer damp of the lowlands, for the
Equatorial climate, and the general absence of bed-coverings,
causes a rheumatic stiffness on rising,
which has to be steamed out by the atmospheric
vapour-bath of the tropical island. A long rickshaw
ride to Tanjong Bungah ("Flowery Point") <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>completes
the day's cure in a sweltering heat, which on
the return journey at 8 a.m. causes even the Chinese
coolies to stop perpetually at wayside stalls, for the
coloured syrups and sticky sweetmeats on which
they perform prodigies of endurance and speed. An
English planter, in his solitary cacao-garden on the
edge of the sea, hails his compatriots with delight,
and leads the way through the rocky ravines
bordering his solitary bungalow. The glories of the
tropics seldom alleviate the sense of exile, and
cloudy England, with her "green fields and pastures
dim," remains dearer than all the pageantry of
Nature elsewhere to most of her absent sons.</p>

<p>The Buddhist temple of Ayer-Etam, built in
ascending tiers on a steep acclivity, varies the
natural interests of Penang, with the marvels of
Chinese architecture elaborated in the deep seclusion
of mountain and forest. The dewy areca-palms
throw a dark network of interlacing shadows across
the red road, winding for miles through the sylvan
scenery, the alchemy of the rising sun transmuting
the myriad feathery fronds into fountains of green
fire. Only the creaking of a bullock-waggon, or the
thud of a falling cocoanut, breaks the hush of the
tropical daybreak, when the leaves only whisper in
their dreams, and the vernal earth, fresh as from
her Creator's hand, renews her strength for the heat
and burden of the coming day. The colossal pile,
consisting of temple, monastery, and innumerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>shrines, amid fountains and fish-ponds, bridges and
balconies, courts and terraces, gleams whitely
against the green gloom of the vast palm-forest on
either side, sloping sharply to the shimmering sea.
The usual appalling images of vermilion and gold
guard every sculptured gateway, and surmount the
painted shrines encircled by parterres of votive
flowers, for the philosophic Buddhism of Ceylon and
Siam gathers the moss and weeds of many an
incongruous accretion in countless ages of pilgrimage
through the Eastern world. The transcendental
mysticism which spun the finest cobwebs of human
thought, crystallises into concrete form when
interpreted in the terms of China, where dim
reminiscences of early Nature worship, and the
terrors which upheld the authority of many obsolete
creeds, have been incorporated into the vague ideals
of Prince Gautama's prophetic soul. Altars, strewn
with fragrant champak-flowers, stand beneath lace-carved
alcoves of black teakwood, on the broad
plateaux which form welcome resting-places beside
each flight of steps on the marble stairway, the
gilded pinnacles and aerial spires of the white
temple sparkling against the sea of rich foliage. A
knot of Burmese worshippers, with rose-coloured
scarves and turbans, throw their infinitesimal coins
on the palm-leaf mats of a red-roofed shrine, and
tell the wooden beads of the Buddhist rosary,
chanting the perpetual refrain of "<i>Pain</i>, <i>Sorrow</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<i>Unreality</i>," as a warning against the temptations of
<i>Maya</i>, the world of illusion. The brown faces
raised imploringly to the presiding deity, a leering
demon with green face and yellow body, inspire
the hope that the grotesque monster may prove his
own unreality by vanishing from the hearts of his
devotees into the limbo of nightmares from which he
has emerged, for the philosophic quietism of Buddhist
creed offers no disguise to the horrors of a hell far
surpassing the terrific literalism of Dante's Inferno.
Rippling conduits edge pillared courts and cloistered
arcades, resplendent with frieze and cornice of blue
and scarlet, a central fountain falling in prismatic
showers over a sacred pond of golden carp. A
white-robed monk smilingly conducts us across
hump-backed bridges and colonnaded galleries to a
bench beneath a grey frangipanni tree, starred with
fragrant flowers, and brings welcome cups of tea,
before another struggle up the interminable steps,
which symbolise the mystic "path" leading to
Nirvana's rest. Further hospitality meets us at a
yellow kiosk, higher up the sacred hill, where a
dainty breakfast of eggs, cakes, and honey stands on
a white table-cloth, bearing a steaming coffee-pot.
The temple paraphernalia of Buddhist worship
strangely resembles Catholic imagery. Incense rises
from open censers on the dais, the blue cloud
enveloping a gorgeous altar, encrusted with gold.
The central figure of Gautama Buddha, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>lotus leaf expresses supernal calm, and the symbolic
flower, in bud, blossom, or foliage, forms the prevailing
design of vase and amphora, within golden
lattice-work. Hanging lamps glow on rapt faces of
attendant saints, or on those supplementary local
Buddhas which Chinese doctrine adds to the comparative
simplicity of the original system. The
foreshadowing of Christian truth culminates in the
fact stated by a Buddhist priest, that bread and wine
of mystic meaning are reserved on the altars of many
among the forty subdivisions of Buddhism. The
mountain Sanctuary, though marred by debased
decoration and heathenised by the lurid figures of the
guardian demons, inspires a reverent devotion, and
exercises a solemnising influence on many souls
whose faith differs from that of the white-clad
monks, who seek to scale the dim heights of
perfection from this lofty peak. "The Light which
lighteth every man" must needs throw a faint and
far-off ray even on an erroneous creed, groping
through the darkness for the outstretched Hands
which embrace all Humanity with boundless Love.</p>

<p>Penang, as a little field of missionary enterprise,
possesses many privileges often denied to the further
islands of Malaysia. The variety of immigrant
races, the constant intercourse with the Indian mainland,
and the needs of travellers belonging to every
nation, keep the settlement in touch with a
multitude of spiritual needs. Christianity, both in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>Anglican and Roman guise, sows diligently in fields
gradually whitening to harvest. The English
Church, with reverent services and kindly priest,
remains a little centre of cherished associations.
The S. Francis Xavier Institute, which brings many
Chinese boys into the Christian fold, through the
labours of another Communion, carries on the work
of the great medi&aelig;val missionary, who reached the
farthest East in his apostolate of love. The scarlet,
yellow, and white veils of Eastern converts, the
crowd of Eurasian Christians in both churches, and
the presence of a devout Malay priest assisting at
the English service, add unfamiliar notes of colour
among the snowy muslins and flower-decked hats
of English residents, but correctness of costume,
both in men and women, contrasts refreshingly with
the slovenly d&eacute;shabille of the Netherlands India, the
last and easily-snapped link between civilisation and
barbarism.</p>

<p>An opportunity occurs for a visit to Taiping, the
capital of the Native Federated States, and situated
in Province Wellesley. The launch crosses to Prai,
the rising port of Malacca, and the northern
terminus of the railway, sure to upset the passenger
lists of the great steamers by traversing the entire
peninsula to Johore. Through a channel bordered
with weird mangroves, the boat enters a long, slow
river, flowing between boundless palm-forests. The
"black but comely" captain of the snorting boat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>escorts his European passengers to the station,
arranges tickets, and waits on the platform till the
train starts; the portly sailor in spotless linen,
surmounted by his genial ebony face, waving
encouragement as long as we remain in sight. The
perils and dangers of the way are <i>nil</i>, and none of
the threatened contingencies arise, but to Eastern
thought risks, however remote and improbable, add
to the value of a journey. Real drawbacks seem
seldom mentioned, but imaginary lions in the way
offer unlimited scope to Oriental fancy, and help to
create a thrilling drama of destruction. Green
paddi-fields, tall sugar-canes, and a world of palms,
rise from the alluvial flats of Province Wellesley.
The great rubber plantations, which form the chief
source of wealth in Malacca, follow in endless
succession, but, as usual, the astute Chinaman has
obtained almost a monopoly of the industry, from
which the greatest fortunes of the tropics are now
derived. The bushy trees, with their black stems
and ragged foliage, are destitute of the beauty so
lavishly bestowed even on the weeds of this fertile
soil. The tangled splendour of the wild jungle,
which presently borders the track, demonstrates the
immense difficulty of pioneering in a tropical forest,
where the interlacing boughs of the myriad trees,
with their impenetrable screen of climbing parasites,
make perpetual walls of living green, defying human
progress. Malay villages, brown and palm-thatched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>in the immemorial style, stand on piles above the
swampy ground, which seems the approved site of
habitation. A barren district devastated by a forest
fire, contains the disused pits of ancient tin-mines,
but these unsightly hollows have been decorated by
Nature's hand with a luxuriant growth of the frilled
pink lotus. Malay children, themselves unadorned,
stand on wayside platforms, every brown hand filled
with the rosy chalices of the sacred Buddhist
emblem. Tradition says that the blossom, drawn
up from the mire by the rays of the morning sun,
symbolised the earth-stained soul, made pure and
stainless by the attraction of that Divine Glory
which Buddhism, though in distorted form, strove to
attain.</p>

<p>At the end of the sixty-mile journey, the English
station-master at Taiping proved a veritable friend
in need, arranging for a hot breakfast at the
station, chartering rickshaw coolies, and&mdash;greatest
blessing of all&mdash;directing the route, with a menacing
pantomime concerning any shirking of duty, which
saved all further trouble. Taiping is in an early
stage of progress, and the open <i>tokos</i> in
waringen-shaded streets, show nothing but the
necessaries of life, with terrible mementos of
Birmingham in petroleum lamps, hideous oleographs,
and machine-made household goods. Pretty bungalows
stand beyond the interlacing avenues of dusky
trees, and a framework toy of a church in the green
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>outskirts, contains numerous brass tablets recording
English lives laid down in this weary land. These
pathetic memorials seem the only permanent
features of the frail edifice in the shadowy God's-acre
already filled with graves. The newly-planted
park, with a lake fringed by a vivid growth of allemanda
and hybiscus, stands below the purple heights
of a long mountain chain, but Taiping offers few
inducements to a prolonged stay, and after a hurried
glimpse of terrific beasts and snakes of the jungle,
preserved in the local museum, we return to the
station, the kindly chef-de-gare disturbing his wife
from her siesta in the adjacent bungalow, to feast us
on tea and bananas. Darkness falls before the train
reaches Penang, but a Chinese gentleman acts as
pilot across some rocking boats, with only a faint
flare from expiring torches to light the way, and
starts the cringing coolies, with true politeness to
the "foreign devils," but manifest wonder at their
eccentric customs. Chinese womanhood, painted,
bedizened, and tottering on the pink and gold hoofs
which cause a sickening shudder to the Western
spectator, indicates the barrier of prejudice to be
surmounted before China can mould national ideals
into harmony with modern progress.</p>

<p>The vicinity of Penang to the Equatorial junction
of the maritime world, widens local interests by
the development of the Malay Peninsula, partly
governed through the instrumentality of native
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>Sultans under English guidance, but the abiding
charm of the island lies beyond the radius of the
thriving port. Nature still reigns supreme in this
jewel of the Equator, where the amber swathes of
Indian laburnum, the golden-hearted whiteness of
luscious frangipanni blossom, and the red fire of the
flamboyant tree, light up the endless aisles of
swaying palms, where temple-flower and tuberose
mingle their fragrance with the breath of clove and
cinnamon, interpreting the imagery of the Eastern
monarch's bridal song, and luring each lover of
Earth's manifold beauty to "go down into her
garden of spices and gather lilies."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<h3>EPILOGUE.</h3>


<p>The infinite variety of interests connected with
the vast Malay Archipelago, mainly dominated by
European authority, can only be inadequately
mentioned in the simple record of a half-year's
wandering through scenes which stamp their unfading
beauty indelibly on mind and memory.
Virgin fields of discovery still invite scientific
exploration, and the green sepulchre of Equatorial
vegetation retains innumerable secrets of Art and
architecture. The geological mysteries of these
volcanic shores offer a host of unsolved problems, the
surpassing magnificence of flower and foliage makes
every island a botanical Paradise, and the varieties
of race and language which moulded and coloured
the destinies of the Equatorial world, supply
historian and philologist with opportunities of
unlimited research. The dim chronicles of a distant
past, inscribed in vague characters with faint traces
of the earliest Malay wanderers, link their shadowy
pages with historic records of falling dynasties and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>warring creeds, preceding the eventful period of
colonial enterprise, initiated by the wild campaigns
in quest of the precious spices. Although the Malay
voyagers remain veiled in the twilight which clouds
the verge of authentic history, the track of their
keels may yet be followed through the conflicting
currents of that hitherto unknown ocean which they
opened to a future world. The forests and fishing
grounds of every coast and island still support the
manifold divisions of the nomadic race which forms
the substratum of island life, and the star of
hope which led them onward, shone for many
subsequent adventurers across those Southern seas
which aroused the energies and ambitions of later
ages. The symbolical stories of the world's infancy
join the actual experience of struggling humanity to
the dreamland from whence it emerged, as some
syren song lured it into unknown regions. The
old-world legends of mankind "launching out into
the deep, and letting down the nets for a draught,"
repeat themselves from age to age, for the human
heart has ever sacrificed comfort and safety in order
to set sail upon some trackless ocean, on the chance
of reaping that harvest of life's sea for which man
yearns with insatiable desire. The wanderings of
Odysseus, in the youth of the world, illustrate the
eternal pursuit of a visionary ideal, in those adventures
which breathe the undying romance of the sea.
The resemblance between the traditions of savage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>and civilised nations appears too strong to be
fortuitous, and indicates the underlying unity of
feeling and purpose implanted in the human race.
Modern environment renders it impossible to calculate
the tremendous force of the mysterious impulse
which swayed the onward march of primeval tribes;
even the later obstacles, overcome by bold spirits
who followed in their wake, can never be adequately
realised amid the artificial conditions of our present
life. The charmed circle of the "Equator's
emerald zone," encloses a region of marvel and
mystery, where Imagination, the fairy with the
magic mirror, helps to interpret and reveal the
secrets of Beauty and Truth, which transfigure
material form and colour with the halo of idealism.
The tale of the mysterious ages when "the threads
of families" were first "woven into the ropes of
nations," still sways mind and fancy, but the
romance of the world continues, though the progress
of Humanity varies the pictured page. In the warm
heart of the tropical Archipelago, Nature, triumphing
in eternal youth, seems to mock the transient phases
of aspiration and achievement, which vanish by turn
into the misty past. The great Mother chants her
"Song of Songs" throughout the myriad changes
of Time, in terms so similar to the imagery of the
Divine Epithalamium that, from a human standpoint,
it seems swept by the spice-laden breezes of
the Malayan Lotus-land, rather than by the fainter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>fragrance wafted from the orchards and gardens of
Palestine or Egypt. Possibly the Syrian fleet, in
search of ivory and peacocks, touched at the
enchanted shores where "all trees of frankincense"
perfumed the air, and produced those aromatic
"powders of the merchant," regarded as priceless
treasures both in primitive and medi&aelig;val days. The
story might well capture the fancy of the royal poet,
and enrich the music of his verse with the luscious
fragrance of a more luxuriant land than even his own
pastoral Canaan, flowing with milk and honey. The
hyperbole of Eastern thought often rests on a solid
foundation of fact, and the Hebrew love-song weaves
tropical Nature's lavish wealth of flower, fruit,
and fragrance into a symbolic garland, flung in
passionate rapture at the feet of the beloved one.
The spiritual significance of the sacred lyric only
transposes the mystic melody into a higher key, and
heaps the thurible of the sanctuary with the frankincense
of praise, to celebrate the typical bridal of
Earth and Heaven.</p>

<p>The diadem of palms on the last outlying islet of
the Malay Archipelago, stands out in dark relief
against the golden haze of the afterglow, which
floods the sky, and changes the purple waters into
a sea of fire. The pageant of sunset lingers for
a moment, and then vanishes beneath of the pall of
the swiftly-falling night. The fairyland of eternal
summer sinks below the horizon, and realities melt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>into the shadows of that mental subconsciousness
which holds the wraiths of departed joys. Memories
of the golden hours spent in threading the flowery
maze of the vast Archipelago, seem a mere handful
of shells gathered on the surf-beaten shores, but if
even the empty shell can hold the sound of the
waves, this brief record of a cruise in sunny seas may
also convey faint whispers of that syren voice which
echoed through the ages of the past, and still allures
the spellbound listener to the swaying palms and
spice-scented bowers of Malaya's Island Paradise.</p>
